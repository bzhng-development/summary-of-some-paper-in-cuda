# Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

**ArXiv:** [2512.08296](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296)

## 🎯 Pitch

This paper derives quantitative scaling principles for LM-based agent systems, identifying how agent count, coordination topology, model capability, and task properties interact to predict when multi-agent coordination helps or hurts. By running 180 controlled, budget-matched configurations across four agentic benchmarks and five canonical architectures, it introduces measurable coordination metrics (efficiency, overhead, redundancy, error amplification) and a predictive model (R^2=0.524) that gives principled guidance for selecting architectures—showing that “more agents” is beneficial only for specific, decomposable tasks and can severely degrade performance for sequential, tool-heavy problems.

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This paper develops quantitative “scaling principles” for LM-based agent systems—rules that predict when moving from a `Single-Agent System (SAS)` to a `Multi-Agent System (MAS)` helps or hurts on genuinely *agentic* tasks that require multi-step interaction with tools/environments. Through a controlled study of `180` matched-budget configurations across `4` agentic benchmarks and `5` canonical architectures, it identifies measurable coordination dynamics (e.g., overhead, efficiency, redundancy, error amplification) that explain performance variation and fit a predictive model with cross-validated `R^2 = 0.524` (Eq. (1), Table 3). The practical significance is that “more agents” is not a general win: benefits depend on task decomposability, tool intensity, and baseline single-agent strength, with some domains seeing large gains (e.g., `+80.8%` on Finance-Agent) and others large degradations (e.g., `−39%` to `−70%` on PlanCraft) (Figure 2, Section 4.2).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem / gap.**
  - Agent systems (LLM-driven loops of reasoning → acting → feedback) are widely used, but design choices—especially whether/how to coordinate multiple agents—remain driven by heuristics rather than quantitative guidance (Introduction).
  - Prior work often reports MAS improvements, but the paper argues many evaluations are conducted on **non-agentic** tasks (static, single-shot benchmarks) where ensembles/voting can help without the coordination burdens that appear in interactive settings (Introduction, Section 2).

- **Why it matters.**
  - Real deployments (e.g., browsing, finance analysis, workflow execution, planning) require **sustained environment interaction**, **partial observability**, and **adaptive strategy updates**. In these settings, coordination can introduce “coordination tax” (message passing + synchronization + lossy compression of state), and errors can cascade through action chains (Introduction; Section 3.2).

- **Prior approaches and shortcomings (as framed by this paper).**
  - Many MAS claims implicitly assume monotonic improvement with team size (“more agents is all you need”), but the paper highlights counter-evidence: as base models get stronger, MAS gains can diminish; and interactive tasks create dynamics (overhead, fragmentation, error propagation) that static accuracy-only reporting misses (Introduction; Section 2).
  - Existing comparisons often confound architecture with prompts/tools/budgets, making it hard to attribute effects to topology itself (Introduction).

- **How this paper positions itself.**
  - It introduces a more rigorous notion of **agentic evaluation** (three necessary properties) (Section 3.2).
  - It runs a **controlled**, matched-budget evaluation across architectures, tools, and prompt structures to isolate topology effects (Section 4.1; Appendix E).
  - It aims to move from categorical “architecture labels” to **measurable coordination metrics** that support prediction on unseen tasks/domains (Section 4.3; Table 3).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The system studied is a family of LLM-based **agent architectures** that solve tasks by repeatedly calling tools and updating state from tool/environment feedback.
- The paper’s “solution shape” is an **empirical scaling framework**: run many controlled SAS/MAS variants on interactive benchmarks, measure coordination behaviors from traces, and fit a predictive regression model that maps task + model + coordination properties to expected performance.

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Inputs:** a benchmark task instance + a fixed tool API set + an LLM (chosen from three model families) + an agent topology (SAS, Independent MAS, Centralized MAS, Decentralized MAS, Hybrid MAS).
- **Process (per instance):**
  1. Agent(s) read the task and decide a tool/action.
  2. The environment returns an observation (tool output, webpage content, inventory state, etc.).
  3. Agents update their history/memory and possibly send messages (MAS only).
  4. An aggregation/orchestration mechanism (if present) synthesizes/coordinates outputs and decides termination.
- **Outputs:** a final answer/action sequence and a success/accuracy outcome, plus trace-derived coordination metrics (overhead, efficiency, redundancy, etc.) (Section 4.1; Table 5).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- First define what counts as an agent system and what distinguishes SAS vs MAS (Section 3.1).
- Then define the task/benchmark notion of “agentic” and why interactive feedback changes scaling behavior (Section 3.2).
- Next specify the five architectures/topologies and what mechanism each isolates (Section 3.1; Table 2).
- Then describe the controlled experimental design (benchmarks, models, budget matching, metrics) (Section 4.1; Appendix E).
- Finally explain the predictive scaling model and how its coefficients encode the paper’s scaling “principles” (Eq. (1), Table 4; Section 4.3).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is an **empirical systems + modeling** paper whose core idea is to treat multi-agent coordination as a measurable process with quantifiable costs/benefits, and then learn a predictive relationship between those measurements and task performance.

#### 3.4.1 Formal agent system definition (what is being evaluated)

- The paper defines an agent system as `S = (A, E, C, Ω)` where `A` is a set of agents, `E` is a shared environment, `C` is a communication topology, and `Ω` is an orchestration policy (Section 3.1).
- Each agent `a_i` is formalized as `S_i = (Φ_i, A_i, M_i, π_i)`:
  - `Φ_i` is the reasoning policy (typically an LLM).
  - `A_i` is an action space consisting of tool calls `ToolCall(t, θ)`.
  - `M_i` is internal memory.
  - `π_i` maps observation histories to actions (Section 3.1).
- Interaction proceeds in timesteps: an agent selects action `α_{i,t} = π_i(h_{i,t})`, the environment returns observation `o_{i,t} = E(α_{i,t})`, and the history updates by appending `(α_{i,t}, o_{i,t})`, subject to context-window truncation at `MAX_TOKENS` (Section 3.1).

#### 3.4.2 SAS vs MAS (mechanistic differences)

- A `Single-Agent System (SAS)` has one “reasoning locus,” meaning all perception/planning/action is within one loop; it has **zero inter-agent communication overhead** and uses a single coherent memory stream (Section 3.1; Section 2 discussion on context integration).
- A `Multi-Agent System (MAS)` has multiple LLM-backed agents that exchange messages, potentially improving exploration/diversity but imposing a **coordination tax** because global context must be compressed into messages (Introduction; Section 2; Section 3.1).

#### 3.4.3 The five evaluated architectures (what each topology does)

The paper evaluates five canonical architectures (Section 4.1; Table 2):

- **SAS:** one agent runs up to `k` reasoning iterations (`O(k)` LLM calls; no coordination overhead).
- **Independent MAS:** multiple agents run in parallel but do **not** communicate with each other; outputs are combined by a synthesis-only aggregator.
  - The paper emphasizes the aggregator “concatenates sub-agent outputs without cross-validation or majority voting,” so any benefit would be from parallel exploration rather than explicit error correction (Section 3.1).
- **Centralized MAS:** one orchestrator coordinates `n` sub-agents across `r` rounds (`O(r n k)`), creating a **validation bottleneck** at the orchestrator (Section 3.1; Table 2).
- **Decentralized MAS:** `n` peers communicate in debate/consensus rounds `d` (`O(d n k)`), with all-to-all message potential and higher memory demands (Section 3.1; Table 2).
- **Hybrid MAS:** combines an orchestrator plus some peer-to-peer communication, increasing protocol complexity and overhead (`O(r n k + p n)` as described) (Section 3.1; Table 2).

These topologies are framed as a “structural ablation” over two coordination dimensions: orchestrator presence (hierarchy) and peer communication (Section 4.1).

#### 3.4.4 What counts as an “agentic” benchmark (and why the paper insists on it)

The paper defines a task as agentic if optimal interactive policy performance exceeds the best single-pass function by more than a threshold `δ` (Section 3.2). Operationally, it requires three necessary benchmark properties (Section 3.2):

- `Sequential Interdependence`: later actions depend on earlier observations.
- `Partial Observability`: important state must be acquired via interaction/tool use.
- `Adaptive Strategy Formation`: the policy must update beliefs/strategy based on feedback.

This matters because static tasks can reward ensembling/voting, while interactive tasks expose overhead and cascading-error dynamics (Introduction; Section 2).

#### 3.4.5 Experimental design (controlled evaluation to isolate topology)

- **Benchmarks (Table 1; Section 4.1; Appendix D):**
  - `BrowseComp-Plus` (web browsing / multi-website info synthesis).
  - `Finance-Agent` (finance analysis tasks).
  - `PlanCraft` (Minecraft-style sequential planning/crafting).
  - `Workbench` (workplace workflows via function/tool calling).
- **Scale:** `180` experiments/configurations (Section 4.1), spanning:
  - `5` architectures (SAS + 4 MAS),
  - `3` LLM families (OpenAI GPT-5 series; Google Gemini 2.x/2.5; Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7/4.0/4.5) (Section 4.1),
  - and multiple capability levels captured by an external “Intelligence Index” axis (Section 4.1; Appendix A).
- **Fairness control / budget matching:**
  - The paper states all configurations are matched for total reasoning-token budget (mean `≈ 4,800` tokens per trial) to isolate architectural effects (Section 4.4; Table 5).
  - MAS gets parallel agent processing but “smaller per-agent iterations,” while SAS gets proportionally more rounds, aiming to equalize total compute (Section 4.1).
- **Implementation (Appendix E):**
  - Unified model access via `LiteLLM` and orchestration/tool integration via `LangChain`.
  - Tools include web search, code execution (Python REPL), mathematical operations, and completion markers, with dataset-specific tool ecosystems (Appendix E.1).
- **Concrete agent-configuration parameters (Appendix E.2):**
  - SAS: max `10` iterations per instance.
  - Independent MAS: `3` agents, synthesis-only coordination.
  - Centralized: `3` sub-agents + `1` orchestrator, max `5` orchestration rounds, `3` iterations per agent per round.
  - Decentralized: `3` agents, `3` debate rounds, `3` iterations per round.
  - Hybrid: centralized orchestration plus limited peer communication phases (Appendix E.2).
- **Evaluation sample sizes (Appendix E.4):**
  - Finance-Agent: `50` instances.
  - BrowseComp-Plus: `100` instances.
  - Workbench: `100` instances.
  - PlanCraft: `100` instances.

#### 3.4.6 Coordination/process metrics (what is measured beyond accuracy)

The paper argues final success alone is insufficient, so it instruments MAS/SAS traces with measurable coordination properties (Section 4.1):

- **Coordination overhead** `O% = (T_MAS − T_SAS)/T_SAS × 100%`, where `T` is “turns” (reasoning–response exchanges) (Section 4.1; Table 5).
- **Message density** `c`: inter-agent messages per reasoning turn (Section 4.1; Table 5).
- **Redundancy rate** `R`: cosine similarity of agent output embeddings (agreement/overlap) (Section 4.1; Table 5).
- **Coordination efficiency** `E_c = S / (T/T_SAS)`: success normalized by relative turn count (Section 4.1).
- **Error amplification** `A_e = E_MAS / E_SAS`: relative failure probability (Section 4.1; Table 5).
- **Token overlap structure** labels tokens in rationales as unique/shared/contradictory, with contradiction detected via a BERTScore-based dissimilarity threshold (Section 4.1; Section 4.4).

It also defines an **information gain** measure `ΔI` (Appendix E.5; Eq. (2)–(3)) as posterior variance reduction for the success variable using Monte Carlo sampling:
- `K = 10` traces sampled at temperature `τ = 0.7` to estimate variance via `p(1-p)` for binary outcomes.

#### 3.4.7 The predictive scaling model (what it predicts and how)

- The paper fits a regression-style “scaling principle” with **main effects** and **mechanism-motivated interactions** (Section 4.3).
- **Predictors include** (Section 4.3; Eq. (1)):
  - Model capability `I` (Intelligence Index, mean-centered at `Ī = 56.9` per Table 4),
  - Tool count `T` (log-transformed),
  - Agent count `n_a` (log-transformed),
  - Single-agent baseline performance `P_SA`,
  - Coordination metrics: `O%`, `c`, `R`, `E_c`, `A_e` (some log-transformed),
  - Selected interactions such as `E_c × T`, `O% × T`, and `P_SA × log(1+n_a)`.
- **Model form:** Eq. (1) in Section 4.3, with standardized predictors (`μ=0, σ=1`) and log transforms for skewed variables (`O%` spans `0–515%`, `T: 4–16`, `n_a: 1–4`, `A_e: 1.0–17.2`) (Section 4.3).
- **Validation:**
  - 5-fold cross-validation with experiment-level holdout yields `R^2_CV = 0.524 ± 0.033`, `MAE = 0.089 ± 0.011`, `RMSE = 0.112 ± 0.014` (Section 4.3; Table 3).
  - Adding coordination metrics improves predictive power over using only architecture labels (`R^2_CV 0.524` vs `0.430`) (Table 3).
- **Worked micro-example (how the model is used in the paper’s decision logic).**
  - The paper derives a **coordination-saturation / baseline threshold** from the interaction `P_SA × log(1+n_a)` (Table 4), stating coordination yields diminishing/negative returns once the single-agent baseline exceeds about `≈ 0.45` (Section 4.3; also highlighted in Abstract/Conclusion).
  - Mechanistically, this is the “baseline paradox”: if SAS is already strong, the remaining headroom is small, and coordination overhead dominates (Section 4.3; Table 4 shows `β̂ = −0.404, p < 0.001` for this interaction).

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

- **(1) A rigorous operationalization of “agentic evaluation.”**
  - Innovation: the paper does not treat any benchmark as valid for evaluating agents/MAS; it requires sequential interdependence, partial observability, and adaptive strategy formation (Section 3.2).
  - Significance: this directly targets a methodological failure mode—drawing MAS conclusions from static tasks where coordination costs are absent or irrelevant (Introduction; Section 2).

- **(2) A controlled, topology-focused evaluation across many configurations.**
  - Innovation: it standardizes tools, prompt structures, and token budgets and varies mainly topology + model capability, across `N=180` configurations (Abstract; Section 4.1).
  - Significance: this is meant to enable causal attribution to coordination structure rather than implementation confounds (Introduction; Section 4.1).

- **(3) Quantitative coordination metrics + predictive modeling outperform architecture labels.**
  - Innovation: the main explanatory variables are process metrics (`E_c`, `O%`, `c`, `R`, `A_e`) measured from traces, not just “centralized vs decentralized” labels (Section 4.1; Table 5).
  - Significance: the best model reaches `R^2_CV = 0.524` and beats an architecture-label model (`0.430`) (Table 3), suggesting the measurable properties capture transferable principles.

- **(4) Three dominant scaling effects (as summarized by the paper).**
  - **Tool–coordination trade-off:** tool-heavy tasks disproportionately suffer from multi-agent overhead under fixed budgets; modeled via `E_c × T` with `β̂ = −0.267, p < 0.001` (Section 4.3; Table 4).
  - **Capability saturation / baseline paradox:** coordination returns diminish or turn negative beyond about `~45%` SAS baseline, tied to `P_SA × log(1+n_a)` with `β̂ = −0.404, p < 0.001` (Abstract; Section 4.3; Table 4).
  - **Topology-dependent error amplification:** Independent MAS amplifies errors dramatically (reported as `17.2×` vs `4.4×` centralized) (Abstract; Table 5; Section 4.4).

- **(5) Task-contingent topology preferences (not one MAS that wins everywhere).**
  - Centralized is best on Finance-Agent with large gains (`+80.8%`) (Section 4.2; Figure 2).
  - Decentralized is best on BrowseComp-Plus with modest gains (`+9.2%`) while centralized is near-flat (`+0.2%`) (Section 4.2; Figure 2).
  - All MAS variants degrade on PlanCraft (−39% to −70%) (Section 4.2; Figure 2).

## 5. Experimental Analysis

### Evaluation methodology (datasets, metrics, setup)

- **Datasets/benchmarks:** BrowseComp-Plus, Finance-Agent, PlanCraft, Workbench (Table 1; Appendix D).
- **Primary metric:** success/accuracy depending on domain (Section 4.1).
- **Secondary/process metrics:** overhead, efficiency, error amplification, redundancy, message density, token-overlap/contradiction, and information gain `ΔI` (Section 4.1; Appendix E.5).
- **Configurations:** 5 architectures × multiple models across 3 families, totaling `180` experiments (Section 4.1).
- **Budget control:** mean `≈ 4,800` tokens per trial matched across conditions (Section 4.4; Table 5).
- **Reliability:** the paper reports inter-rater reliability for factual error rate validators with Cohen’s κ values (e.g., Finance Agent `0.91`, Workbench `0.89`, PlanCraft `0.87`, BrowseComp-Plus `0.88`) (Section 4.1).

### Main quantitative results (with specific numbers)

**Per-benchmark MAS vs SAS (Section 4.2; Figure 2):**

- **Finance-Agent:** strong MAS gains across topologies.
  - Centralized: `0.631` vs SAS `0.349` → `+80.8%` (Section 4.2).
  - Decentralized: `0.609` → `+74.5%`.
  - Hybrid: `0.604` → `+73.1%`.
- **BrowseComp-Plus:** mixed; Independent is harmful, structured coordination yields small gains.
  - Decentralized: `0.347` vs SAS `0.318` → `+9.2%`.
  - Centralized: `+0.2%` (near-flat).
  - Independent: `−35%` (Figure 2 caption; Section 4.2 provides the “modest gains” story and highlights independent underperformance).
- **Workbench:** small effects.
  - Decentralized: `0.664` vs SAS `0.629` → `+5.7%`.
  - Centralized and Hybrid: around `−1.2%` (Section 4.2).
- **PlanCraft:** consistent MAS degradation.
  - Independent: `0.170` vs SAS `0.568` → `−70.1%`.
  - Centralized: `0.282` → `−50.3%`.
  - Decentralized: `0.332` → `−41.5%`.
  - Hybrid: `0.346` → `−39.1%` (Section 4.2; Figure 2).

**Across-architecture coordination costs and dynamics (Table 5; Section 4.4):**

- Mean success rate `S`:
  - SAS `0.466`, Independent `0.370`, Decentralized `0.477`, Centralized `0.463`, Hybrid `0.452` (Table 5).
- Mean turns `T`:
  - SAS `7.2 ± 2.1`, Independent `11.4 ± 3.2`, Decentralized `26.1 ± 7.5`, Centralized `27.7 ± 8.1`, Hybrid `44.3 ± 12.4` (Table 5).
- Overhead `O%` relative to SAS:
  - Independent `58%`, Decentralized `263%`, Centralized `285%`, Hybrid `515%` (Table 5).
- Efficiency `E_c`:
  - SAS `0.466`, Independent `0.234`, Decentralized `0.132`, Centralized `0.120`, Hybrid `0.074` (Table 5).
- Error amplification `A_e`:
  - SAS `1.0`, Independent `17.2`, Decentralized `7.8`, Centralized `4.4`, Hybrid `5.1` (Table 5).

**Predictive modeling results (Section 4.3; Table 3):**

- Full model with coordination metrics: `R^2_train = 0.613`, `R^2_CV = 0.524`, `AIC = −201.2`, `20` parameters (Table 3).
- Baselines:
  - Intelligence + tools + agents only: `R^2_CV = 0.283` (Table 3).
  - + architecture labels: `R^2_CV = 0.430` (Table 3).

**Key coefficient-based claims (Table 4):**

- `E_c × T` has `β̂ = −0.267, p < 0.001` (tool–coordination trade-off).
- `P_SA × log(1+n_a)` has `β̂ = −0.404, p < 0.001` (baseline paradox/capability saturation).
- `O% × T` has `β̂ = −0.162, p < 0.001` (overhead compounds with tool complexity).
- Intelligence main effect: `β̂ = 0.171, p = 0.001`; quadratic term not significant (Table 4).

### Do the experiments support the claims?

- **Task-contingent coordination:** The per-benchmark deltas (Figure 2) strongly support the claim that MAS benefits are not universal and can be negative, including large negative effects on PlanCraft.
- **Cost/overhead as a central driver:** Table 5 shows drastic turn and overhead increases for MAS, especially Hybrid. This aligns with the paper’s narrative that under fixed budgets, coordination consumes reasoning capacity (Section 4.4).
- **Predictability via measurable coordination metrics:** The improvement from `R^2_CV 0.430` (architecture labels) to `0.524` (coordination metrics) (Table 3) supports the claim that process metrics carry additional explanatory power beyond topology categories.
- **Caveat:** The paper reports dramatic architecture differences in error amplification (`A_e`), but in the regression, the main effect of `log(1+A_e)` and `A_e × T` are not significant (Table 4; Section 4.3). That internally complicates a simple story of “error amplification drives performance,” and the paper itself interprets error differences as being subsumed by other metrics (efficiency/overhead) in the multivariate model (Section 4.3).

### Ablations / robustness checks / out-of-sample validation

- **Model comparison ablation:** progressively adding predictors (Table 3) functions as an ablation showing what improves prediction.
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold CV with stable coefficient estimates and diagnostics (Section 4.3).
- **Out-of-sample validation:** on `GPT-5.2` (Intelligence Index `75`), the model reports `MAE = 0.071` (Appendix B; Table 7) and validates `4/5` qualitative findings (Table 8), with a noted partial validation where decentralized vs centralized advantages converge at high capability (Table 8).
- **Important caveat in Appendix B:** the paper notes SAS performance is systematically over-predicted out of training range (Table 9), suggesting calibration issues when extrapolating beyond the Intelligence Index range used to fit the model.

---

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Limited architecture coverage.**
  - Only five canonical topologies are tested (SAS + four MAS). Other orthogonal design dimensions (specialization, memory design, aggregation rules beyond “synthesis-only,” etc.) are explicitly out of scope (Section 3.1 footnote; Limitations Section 5).

- **Agent-count scaling is only partially explored.**
  - The main controlled suite uses small teams (Appendix E.2 uses 3-agent MAS configurations), with additional exploration up to `n_a ∈ {1,3,5,7,9}` shown for some cases (Figure 5).
  - The paper finds turn count scales super-linearly with agent count (`T = 2.72 × (n+0.5)^{1.724}`, `R^2=0.974`) (Section 4.4), implying practical ceilings beyond ~3–4 agents under fixed budgets, but this is not fully mapped across all domains/models.

- **Prompt optimality is not pursued.**
  - Prompts are held identical across conditions for experimental validity, but architecture- or model-specific prompt tuning could change scaling behavior (Limitations (iv)).

- **Benchmark coverage is diverse but still narrow.**
  - Four benchmarks span finance, browsing, planning, and workplace tools, but may not represent embodied/multimodal or long-horizon temporal feedback settings (Limitations (v)).

- **Predictive model is only moderately explanatory and may not extrapolate cleanly.**
  - `R^2_CV = 0.524` means substantial variance remains unexplained (Section 4.3).
  - Out-of-range extrapolation shows calibration issues (Appendix B; Table 9), including over-prediction for SAS on GPT-5.2.

- **Economic/latency cost is a first-class trade-off.**
  - MAS token efficiency is much worse than SAS in Table 5 (e.g., success per 1K tokens: SAS `67.7` vs Hybrid `13.6`), and overhead reaches `515%` for Hybrid (Table 5), which directly constrains practical deployment (Section 4.4; Limitations (vi)).

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the field’s framing (within the paper’s scope).**
  - It argues that “agent scaling” should be studied like an empirical science: not by counting agents, but by quantifying coordination costs and task properties that determine when coordination is net-positive (Abstract; Sections 4.2–4.3).
  - It pushes evaluation toward **agentic benchmarks** and away from static tasks as a proxy for agent performance (Section 3.2).

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases.**
  - **Architecture selection by task type** (supported by Figure 2 and Section 4.3 examples):
    - Prefer **SAS** for **sequential constraint-satisfaction** tasks like PlanCraft, where all MAS variants degrade (`−39%` to `−70%`) (Figure 2; Section 4.2).
    - Prefer **Centralized MAS** for **parallelizable analysis** tasks like Finance-Agent, where centralized gains are largest (`+80.8%`) (Figure 2; Section 4.2).
    - Prefer **Decentralized MAS** for **dynamic browsing/navigation** where peer exploration and fusion helps modestly (`+9.2%`) and centralized is near-neutral (`+0.2%`) (Figure 2; Section 4.2).
  - **Budget-aware design:** Table 5 implies that if token/latency budgets are tight, Hybrid-style coordination can be dominated by overhead.

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (when to prefer what, per the paper).**
  - Use MAS only when the task is **decomposable into parallel subtasks** and the **single-agent baseline is below ~0.45**, because the paper reports a capability/baseline saturation threshold beyond which coordination returns diminish (Abstract; Section 4.3).
  - Avoid MAS for tasks where decomposition is artificial (PlanCraft example in Section 4.2), because coordination messages consume budget without adding useful information.
  - Track measurable metrics like `O%`, `E_c`, and message density `c` from traces (Section 4.1; Table 5) and treat them as design targets, not just post-hoc analytics.

- **Follow-up research directions explicitly suggested by the paper (Limitations Section 5).**
  - Explore whether larger collectives can overcome super-linear overhead via emergent specialization or self-organization, versus being fundamentally bottlenecked by communication (Limitations (i)).
  - Study heterogeneity beyond same-family scale differences, including mixing different model architectures or specialized fine-tunes (Limitations (ii); also Figure 4 analyzes heterogeneous-role effects within families).
  - Develop coordination protocols for tool-intensive tasks (tool scheduling, routing, hierarchical tool delegation), since tool–coordination interactions are a primary failure mode (Limitations (iii); Section 4.3).
  - Extend to more environments (embodied, multimodal, long-horizon feedback) to test generality of the scaling principles (Limitations (v)).
