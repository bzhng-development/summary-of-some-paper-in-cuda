# Probing Scientific General Intelligence of LLMs
with Scientist-Aligned Workflows

**ArXiv:** [2512.16969](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16969)

## 🎯 Pitch

We introduce a principled operational definition of Scientific General Intelligence (SGI) and present SGI-Bench — a scientist-aligned, multi-domain benchmark plus an agentic evaluation framework that measures end-to-end research workflows across Deliberation, Conception, Action, and Perception. By revealing concrete gaps in current LLMs (e.g., numerical fidelity, protocol sequencing, multimodal comparison) and demonstrating Test-Time Reinforcement Learning to boost idea novelty, this work provides a practical roadmap and tools to advance AI systems that can reliably participate in real scientific discovery.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This work defines **Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)** as an AI system that can autonomously carry out the full iterative cycle of scientific inquiry—**Deliberation → Conception → Action → Perception**—and operationalizes that definition with a benchmark, **SGI-Bench**, spanning four scientist-aligned task families. It pairs the benchmark with an **agent-based evaluation framework** (`SGIEvalAgent`) and reports that current frontier LLMs and agents show fragmented competence: they often produce plausible intermediate reasoning or executable code, but still fail at end-to-end scientific correctness, workflow fidelity, and multimodal comparison. The paper also introduces **Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)** with retrieval-based novelty rewards to improve idea novelty without reference answers.

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem / gap addressed**
  - “Scientific ability” in LLMs is often evaluated via **static QA** or isolated reasoning tests that capture only parts of scientific work (e.g., knowledge recall, tool use), but not the **full workflow** that human scientists follow.
  - The paper targets the lack of a **coherent, measurable framework** for “SGI”—i.e., the capability to *conceive*, *investigate*, *execute*, and *interpret* across domains.

- **Why this matters**
  - Scientific inquiry is a structured, long-horizon process involving evidence gathering, synthesis, experimentation (computational or lab), and interpretation, often with iterative correction loops.
  - If “AGI-like” capability is debated, scientific inquiry is positioned as a high bar because it requires **planning**, **numerical rigor**, **procedural discipline**, and **evidence-grounded interpretation**, not just fluent text.

- **Prior approaches and shortcomings (as framed in the provided content)**
  - Benchmarks like `MMLU` and `SuperGPQA` largely map to **Deliberation** (multidisciplinary knowledge understanding).
  - Benchmarks like `GAIA` emphasize procedural **Action** (tool use).
  - `HLE` increases difficulty but still isolates inquiry stages, and framing remains largely **closed-domain QA**, not workflow integration.
  - Result: evaluations are **fragmented**—they don’t measure whether a system can “close the loop” of scientific inquiry.

- **How this paper positions itself**
  - It anchors SGI in the **Practical Inquiry Model (PIM)** quadrants:
    - `Deliberation`: search/synthesis/critical evaluation.
    - `Conception`: idea/hypothesis/method generation.
    - `Action`: executing experiments (dry/wet).
    - `Perception`: interpreting results (often multimodal).
  - It then implements a benchmark explicitly mapping each quadrant to a **task family** (Figure 1, Figure 2).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The system is a **workflow-centric benchmark + agentic evaluator** that tests whether AI systems can perform key parts of the scientific research loop in a structured, reproducible way.
- It solves the evaluation problem by turning “scientific inquiry” into **four task categories** with **task-specific metrics**, and evaluates models using a tool-augmented **Agent-as-a-judge** framework (`SGIEvalAgent`).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **SGI definition layer (PIM)** → defines the four inquiry stages.
- **SGI-Bench dataset layer** → provides curated tasks across 10 scientific domains, split into four task families.
- **Metrics layer** → defines per-task multi-dimensional metrics (exact-match, step-level scoring, code unit tests, sequence similarity, multimodal MCQ accuracy, etc.).
- **Evaluation layer (`SGIEvalAgent`)**:
  - `Questioning Agent` selects questions.
  - `Metric Customization Agent` optionally adds user-defined metrics and merges them with built-in ones.
  - `LLM/Agent Runner` produces model outputs with tool access when configured.
  - `Eval Agent` computes scores (including LLM-judge step grading).
  - `Reporting Agent` generates an evaluation report (Figure 10).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- I first explain the **SGI operationalization** via PIM and how tasks map to quadrants (Figures 1–2).
- Then I detail each **task definition** (inputs/outputs/formulation) for the four task families (Figures 3–7; Tables 1–4).
- Next I explain the **metrics** for each task family (Section 2.2), including the formulas.
- Then I describe **data construction** (scientist alignment, cleaning, difficulty filtering) and dataset scale (Section 2.3–2.4).
- Finally I explain the **evaluation framework** (`SGIEvalAgent`) and the **TTRL** method (Figures 10, 26–28; Table 8).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is an **empirical benchmark + evaluation framework** paper, with an additional **test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL)** method to improve idea-generation novelty. The core idea is to operationalize “scientific inquiry capability” as a cycle and to measure each quadrant with tasks that resemble scientist workflows and have explicit metrics.

#### 3.4.1 SGI definition via Practical Inquiry Model (PIM)

- The paper defines SGI as the ability to “autonomously navigate the complete, iterative cycle of scientific inquiry” (Introduction; Figure 1).
- It uses the **PIM quadrants** as a taxonomy:
  - **Deliberation**: searching, synthesizing, critically evaluating knowledge.
  - **Conception**: generating ideas (hypotheses and method plans).
  - **Action**: executing experiments (computational and lab-protocol).
  - **Perception**: interpreting outcomes (often with multimodal evidence).
- SGI-Bench maps these quadrants to four task categories (Figure 1; Figure 2):
  - `Scientific Deep Research` ↔ Deliberation
  - `Idea Generation` ↔ Conception
  - `Dry/Wet Experiment` ↔ Action
  - `Experimental Reasoning` ↔ Perception

#### 3.4.2 Task family 1: Scientific Deep Research (Deliberation)

**What it is.** A literature-inquiry–centric task combining AI “deep research” style multi-step retrieval with a meta-analysis flavor focused on *precise, verifiable outputs* (Section 2.1.1).

**Task I/O and formulation (Figure 3).**
- **Inputs**:
  - `Background (B)`: topic context and terminology disambiguation.
  - `Constraints (C)`: assumptions, data sources, settings.
  - `Data (D)`: any given empirical data or values referenced by the question.
  - `Question (Q)`: focused query, often quantitative.
  - `Response Requirements (R)`: required units/format (e.g., decimals).
- **Outputs**:
  - `Steps (S)`: step-by-step procedure (retrieval + reasoning).
  - `Answer (A)`: short numerical/string answer.
- Formally: `S, A = LLM/Agent(B, C, D, Q, R)`.

**Why it is constrained.**
- The benchmark narrows deep research to **literature inquiry** rather than open-ended report writing to keep evaluation **reproducible** (Section 2.1.1).

**Subtypes (Table 1).**
- `Data`: retrieve/analyze structured datasets or counts.
- `Property`: infer material/molecular/system properties.
- `Micro-experiment`: small controlled lab-like experiments.
- `Macro-experiment`: large-scale observational/natural experiments.

**Metrics (Section 2.2.1).**
- `Exact Match (EM)`: binary correctness of final answer (1 if exact match else 0).
- `Step-Level Accuracy (SLA)`: LLM-judge evaluates each reasoning step vs a reference; computed as  
  \[
  SLA = \frac{\#\text{ correct reasoning steps}}{\#\text{ total reasoning steps}}.
  \]

**Micro-example (from Figure 11).**
- A Chua’s circuit question requires (i) finding a specific paper, (ii) computing RC time constant \( \tau=RC \) in microseconds, (iii) reading hysteresis loop voltage range at a given frequency, (iv) identifying a critical frequency threshold. The example answer format is “2.23, 3.2, 10”, showing how the task forces **retrieval + computation + formatting**.

#### 3.4.3 Task family 2: Idea Generation (Conception)

**What it is.** A structured “methodology design” task rather than unconstrained hypothesis brainstorming, because fully open-ended idea quality is hard to score reliably at scale (Section 2.1.2).

**Task I/O and formulation (Figure 4).**
- **Inputs**:
  - `Related Work (RW)`, `Challenge (C)`, `Limitation (L)`, `Motivation (M)`,
  - `Task Objective (TO)`, `Existing Solutions (ES)`.
- **Outputs** (structured idea decomposition):
  - `Core Idea (CI)`
  - `Implementation Steps (IS)`
  - `Implementation Order (IO)`
  - `Data (D)` (data to use / collect)
  - `Evaluation Metrics (EM)`
  - `Expected Outcome (EO)`
- Formally: `CI, IS, IO, D, EM, EO = LLM/Agent(RW, C, L, M, TO, ES)`.

**Why structure matters.**
- The decomposition is meant to expose whether an “idea” is actually *executable*: it should specify steps, ordering, data, metrics, and expected results (Section 2.1.2).

**Metrics: hybrid subjective + objective (Section 2.2.2).**
- Four dimensions: `Effectiveness`, `Novelty`, `Detailedness`, `Feasibility`.
- **Subjective component**: pairwise comparison vs expert reference ideas using **three LLM judges**, each casting **two votes** → **six votes per dimension**; score uses win rate.
- **Objective components**:
  - Effectiveness: expert keywords (3–5) hit rate (semantic matches allowed).
  - Novelty: dissimilarity from prior related work (lower similarity = higher novelty).
  - Detailedness: completeness of required components + redundancy penalty via sentence-level similarity.
  - Feasibility: compare an extracted “implementation graph” to an expert template graph.
- Each dimension combines objective score and LLM win rate by averaging, e.g.:
  - \[
    \text{Effectiveness} = \frac{\text{Keyword Hit Rate} + \text{LLM Win Rate}}{2}.
    \]
  - \[
    \text{Feasibility} = \frac{\text{Graph Similarity} + \text{LLM Win Rate}}{2}.
    \]

#### 3.4.4 Task family 3: Dry/Wet Experiment (Action)

This family measures whether models can operationalize a plan into either (i) code that runs and is correct (**dry**) or (ii) a step-by-step lab protocol (**wet**), under constrained formulations for reproducibility (Section 2.1.3; Figures 5–6).

##### Dry Experiment (code completion)

**Task setup (Figure 5; Figure 16).**
- Input provides:
  - `Background (B)`: scientific context from code/comments.
  - `Data Code (D)`: code that constructs inputs/data.
  - `Main Code (M)`: script with masked/missing functions (signatures + docstrings preserved).
- Output:
  - `Functions (F)`: completed missing functions.
- Formally: `F = LLM/Agent(B, D, M)`.

**Function categories (Table 2).**
- `Numerical Calculation`, `Statistical Analysis`, `Simulation`, `Metric Calculation`, `Data Processing`, `Predictive Modeling`.

**Metrics (Section 2.2.3; Table 7).**
- Each problem has **5 unit tests**.
- `PassAll@k`: proportion of problems where **k or more** unit tests pass (with k ∈ {1,3,5} reported; `PassAll@5` is strictest).
  \[
  PassAll@k = \frac{\#\text{ problems with ≥k tests passed}}{\#\text{ total problems}}.
  \]
- `SER` (Smooth Execution Rate): fraction of generated code that runs without runtime errors.
- `AET` (Average Execution Time): average runtime across tests:
  \[
  AET = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i.
  \]

**Why dry experiments expose scientific weakness.**
- The benchmark separates **syntactic validity** (SER) from **scientific correctness** (PassAll@k), which becomes important in results (Section 4.5.1).

##### Wet Experiment (protocol planning)

**Task setup (Figure 6; Figure 19).**
- Input provides:
  - `Background (B)`: experimental objective/context.
  - `Action Pool (AP)`: predefined atomic actions with parameters and I/O schemas.
- Output:
  - `Atomic Action Order (AAO)`
  - `Atomic Action Parameters (AAP)`
- Formally: `AAO, AAP = LLM/Agent(B, AP)`.

**Metrics (Section 2.2.3).**
- `Sequence Similarity (SS)`: inversion-based similarity between action orderings:
  - Let `Inv(seq_model, seq_ref)` be number of discordant pairs; for length `n`:
    \[
    SS = 1 - \frac{Inv(seq_{model}, seq_{ref})}{n(n-1)/2}.
    \]
  - SS=1 means identical ordering; SS=0 means maximal disorder.
- `Parameter Accuracy (PA)`: fraction of correctly specified parameters:
  \[
  PA = \frac{\#\text{ correct parameters}}{\#\text{ total parameters}}.
  \]

#### 3.4.5 Task family 4: Experimental Reasoning (Perception)

**What it is.** A multimodal, data-analysis–oriented reasoning task where models interpret images and answer a multiple-choice question with ≥10 options (Section 2.1.4; Figure 7; Figure 23).

**Inputs/outputs (Figure 7).**
- Input:
  - `Multiple Experimental Images (MEI)`
  - `Question (Q)`
- Output:
  - `Reasoning (R)` (step-by-step explanation)
  - `Answer (A)` (selected option)
- Formally: `R, A = LLM/Agent(MEI, Q)`.

**Modalities (Table 3; Figure 22).**
- `Process images`, `Observation images`, `Experiment images`, `Simulation images`, `Visualization images`.

**Reasoning paradigms (Table 4).**
- `Signal Perception`, `Attribute Understanding`, `Comparative Reasoning`, `Causal Reasoning`.

**Metrics (Section 2.2.4).**
- `MCA` (Multi-choice Accuracy): exact match on the selected option.
- `RV` (Reasoning Validity): LLM-judge gives 0–10 score for reasoning quality vs reference reasoning; averaged across samples.

#### 3.4.6 Dataset construction (“scientist alignment”) and scale

**Domains and sourcing.**
- Tasks span **10 scientific domains**: astronomy, chemistry, earth science, energy, information science, life science, materials science, neuroscience, physics, math (Section 2; Figure 8).

**Data construction pipeline (Section 2.3; Figure 2).**
- The pipeline includes:
  1. **Raw corpus collection** with domain experts; seed questions inspired by **Science’s 125 Big Questions** and expert research directions.
  2. **Question construction** by >100 Masters/PhD annotators with scientist feedback; questions reference original sources for traceability.
  3. **Data cleaning**:
     - rule-based filters,
     - model-based consistency checks,
     - expert review (including executability checks for dry experiment code).
  4. **Difficulty filtering** using six high-performance models with web search/deep reasoning enabled; questions solvable by >50% of those models are removed.

**Dataset size (Section 2.4).**
- Total: **over 1,000 samples**.
- Breakdown:
  - `Scientific Deep Research`: **318**
  - `Idea Generation`: **315**
  - `Dry Experiment`: **271**
  - `Wet Experiment`: **68**
  - `Experimental Reasoning`: **291**

#### 3.4.7 SGIEvalAgent: agentic evaluation framework

**Why agentic evaluation.**
- The benchmark uses many specialized metrics (unit tests, graph similarity, inversion distance, step grading), so a single “LLM-as-a-judge” is insufficient (Section 3).

**Four-stage evaluation (Figure 10; Section 3.1–3.4).**
1. **Question Selection**
   - A `Questioning Agent` selects a subset based on user query, domain, and intent.
2. **Metric Customization**
   - A `Customization Agent` generates novel metrics from user intent and merges them with pre-defined metrics (Section 3.2).
3. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - A tool-augmented runner executes the target model/agent; an `Eval Agent` computes scores and rationales (Section 3.3).
   - Tool pool includes web search, PDF parser, Python interpreter, file reader, metric-specific functions.
4. **Report Generation**
   - A `Reporting Agent` compiles results into a report (Section 3.4).

**Tool-integrated reasoning analysis (Section 5.2; Figure 29).**
- Across evaluated agent workflows:
  - `web_search`: **539 calls (33.98%)**
  - `visit_webpage`: **385 calls (24.27%)**
  - `final_answer`: **358 calls (22.57%)**
  - `python_interpreter`: **200 calls (12.61%)**
  - `wikipedia_search`: **104 calls (6.56%)**
- Latency variability is tool-dominated; `visit_webpage` ranges from **5.37 s** to **114.29 s** across models (a **21.28×** spread).

#### 3.4.8 TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for idea novelty

**Motivation.**
- Idea generation lacks ground-truth labels, so standard supervised/RL pipelines struggle to define correctness (Section 5.1).

**Core mechanism (Figure 26; Section 5.1.1).**
- Use online retrieval as a moving “baseline” and reward ideas that are **dissimilar** to retrieved related works.
- Training backbone: `GRPO` (Group Relative Policy Optimization).
- For a query `Q`, policy `π_θ` samples a group of outputs `{o_1, …, o_k}`.

**Reward definition (Equations (1)–(5)).**
- Total reward:
  \[
  R(o) = R_{format}(o) + R_{novelty}(o, W)
  \]
  where `W = {w_1, …, w_n}` are retrieved related works.
- Format reward enforces strict XML tags:
  \[
  R_{format}(o) = \mathbb{I}(\text{output follows }<think>...</think><answer>...</answer>)
  \]
- Novelty via embedding dissimilarity:
  - Compute average cosine similarity:
    \[
    S_{avg} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{e_{idea}\cdot e_{w_j}}{\|e_{idea}\|\|e_{w_j}\|}
    \]
  - Convert to innovation score:
    \[
    S_{inn} = clip((1 - S_{avg})\times 10, 0, 10)
    \]
  - Gate with threshold `τ = 5`:
    \[
    R_{novelty}(o, W) = \mathbb{I}(S_{inn}>\tau)
    \]
- Conceptually: the model gets rewarded if its idea is **far enough** (in embedding space) from retrieved papers and in correct format.

**Hyperparameters (Table 8).**
- Base model: `Qwen3-8B`
- RL algorithm: `GRPO`
- Precision: `bfloat16`
- Learning rate: `5 × 10^-7`
- Max length: `2048`
- Generations `G`: `8`
- Temperature: `1.0`
- Batch size: `4`
- Related works `n`: `4`
- Reward weights: `1:1` (format:novelty)

**Observed training dynamics (Figure 27).**
- Format reward saturates quickly near 1.0; novelty reward increases more gradually.

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

1. **A principle-grounded operational definition of SGI via PIM (Figure 1; Section 1–2).**
   - Novelty: SGI is not treated as a vague aspiration but decomposed into four interdependent capabilities tied to a known inquiry model.
   - Significance: enables benchmark design that checks whether systems can cover *all quadrants*, not just recall or reasoning.

2. **SGI-Bench: workflow-centric, cross-disciplinary tasks with scientist-aligned construction (Figure 2; Sections 2.3–2.4).**
   - Novelty: tasks are built from expert-provided materials and iteratively vetted, with explicit filtering for difficulty (removing questions solvable by >50% of strong models under tool-augmented settings).
   - Significance: pushes evaluation beyond “easy-to-grade QA” toward workflow competence, while keeping tasks reproducible via constrained formulations.

3. **Multi-dimensional, task-specific metrics designed to expose “local plausibility vs global correctness” gaps (Section 2.2).**
   - Examples:
     - `SLA` vs `EM` for deep research isolates step correctness vs final answer correctness.
     - `SER` vs `PassAll@k` isolates code executability vs scientific correctness.
     - `RV` vs `MCA` isolates explanation plausibility vs correct discrimination in multimodal reasoning.
   - Significance: the benchmark is engineered to reveal characteristic failure modes where LLMs sound right but are wrong.

4. **`SGIEvalAgent`: an agent-based evaluation stack with tool support and customizable metrics (Figure 10; Section 3; Figure 30).**
   - Novelty: evaluation is framed as an agentic pipeline rather than a single judge call, enabling computation-heavy scoring (unit tests, graph similarity) and user-defined rubrics.
   - Significance: makes the benchmark more extensible for real-world “scientist needs” (e.g., custom rigor metrics).

5. **TTRL for open-ended idea novelty without ground truth (Section 5.1; Figure 26–28; Table 8).**
   - Novelty: test-time RL uses retrieval-conditioned novelty rewards to improve idea generation even when no reference answer exists.
   - Significance: points to SGI as a **dynamic capacity** that can improve at inference time with minimal feedback loops, not purely via offline training.

## 5. Experimental Analysis

### Evaluation methodology and setup (Section 4.1)

- **Models evaluated** include a large list of open-weight and closed-weight LLMs and multiple agent systems (Section 4.1).
- **Inference settings**:
  - Temperature is set to **0** “for benchmarking consistency” (Section 4.1).
  - A “standard zero-shot, task-specific prompt template” is used across tasks (Section 4.1).
- **Important missing details (cannot be filled from provided content)**:
  - The paper does **not** provide per-model training hyperparameters (optimizer, batch size, training tokens, etc.) for the evaluated proprietary/open models in the excerpt provided; therefore, those cannot be summarized reliably here.

### Main quantitative results (Tables 5–7; Section 4.2)

**Overall SGI-Score remains low.**
- Table 5 reports SGI-Score as an average across tasks, with the best aggregate around **33.83/100** (`Gemini-3-Pro`).
- The paper emphasizes that even the best systems are far from “proficient” integrated scientific inquiry.

**Cross-task snapshot highlights (Table 5).**
- **Deep Research (Exact Match, strict)**:
  - Best reported: **18.48** (`Gemini-3-Pro`).
  - Many models cluster around **~8–16**.
- **Idea Generation (average of four metrics)**:
  - Highest reported: **55.40** (`GPT-5`) and **55.03** (`GPT-5.2-Pro`).
- **Dry Experiments (PassAll@5, strict)**:
  - Best reported: **36.64** (`Gemini-3-Pro`).
  - Other high scores include **35.79** (`o4-mini`, `Claude-Sonnet-4.5`) and **34.69** (`Claude-Opus-4.1`).
- **Wet Experiments (average of SS and PA)**:
  - Example strong scores: **37.92** (`Grok-3`), **36.63** (`GPT-4.1`), **33.62** (`Qwen3-Max`).
- **Experimental Reasoning (MCA, strict)**:
  - Best reported: **41.92** (`Gemini-3-Pro`), with other strong results around the high 30s (Table 5 shows **39.18** for `GPT-5.2-Pro`, **38.83** for `Claude-Opus-4.1`, **38.49** for `GPT-4.1`).

**Closed vs open performance gap is described as marginal (Section 4.2).**
- Table 5 includes an example comparison:
  - `Claude-Sonnet-4.5` SGI-Score **32.16** vs `Qwen3-Max` **31.97** (marked with * for multimodal series versions).
- The paper interprets this as “scale and access alone” not yielding robust scientific cognition.

### Deep Research detailed findings (Section 4.3; Figures 12–14)

- **Key pattern**: `SLA` is much higher than `EM`.
  - Several systems exceed **50% SLA**, with best around **~65%** (Section 4.3), but `EM` stays around **~10%** and “seldom above 20%”.
  - Interpretation in the paper: models often produce locally consistent steps but fail globally (reasoning-chain collapse).
- **Task-type breakdown** (Figure 14; Table 10):
  - Data/Properties are hardest; Micro/Macro experiment types are relatively less bad but still generally low, “rarely exceeds 30%”.

### Idea Generation findings (Section 4.4; Table 6)

- Table 6 shows:
  - `GPT-5` average **55.40** with very high `Novelty` **76.08** and `Detailedness` **85.72**, but low `Feasibility` **18.87**.
  - Best `Feasibility` is **22.90** (`o3`), while many models are in the **~14–20** range.
- The paper’s diagnosis:
  - LLMs produce novel, elaborate ideas but omit executable details (data acquisition, hyperparameters/resources, module interfaces, ordering).

### Dry Experiment findings (Section 4.5.1; Table 7; Figure 17; Figure 18)

- **Executability vs correctness gap**:
  - Many top models have high `SER` (often >90%), but `PassAll@5` remains ≤ **36.64%** (Table 7).
  - Example: `Gemini-3-Pro` has `SER` **98.85%** but `PassAll@5` **36.64%**.
- **Hardest function types**:
  - The paper highlights `Numerical Calculation` and `Simulation` functions as hardest (Figure 17; narrative in Section 4.5.1).
- **Case study demonstrates methodological sensitivity** (Figure 18):
  - Two solutions for comoving volume differ by numerical integration approach:
    - One uses `scipy.integrate.quad` (adaptive integration).
    - Another uses cumulative sum / trapezoidal-style approximation that accumulates error.
  - The case is used to argue that scientific code requires choosing numerically appropriate methods, not just writing runnable code.

### Wet Experiment findings (Section 4.5.2; Figure 20; Figure 21)

- `SS` remains uniformly low; closed models are somewhat higher but still poor (Figure 20).
- `PA` is modest and sometimes competitive across open/closed models.
- Case study (Figure 21) shows failures in:
  - temporal sampling logic,
  - branch-aware protocol structure,
  - multi-sample bookkeeping (e.g., repeated PBMC isolation per time point).

### Experimental Reasoning findings (Section 4.6; Figures 24–25; Table 13)

- **RV > MCA** is common (Figure 24): models can produce plausible reasoning even when wrong.
- **Comparative reasoning is weakest** (Figure 25; Table 13 shows comparative is consistently lower than signal/causal for many models).
- **Domain variability**:
  - Higher accuracy in astronomy/chemistry; lower in materials/life/earth (Section 4.6; Figure 25).

### Does the evidence support the claims?

- The reported metrics align well with the claims about “fragmentation” because multiple task families show the same structural gap:
  - `SLA` > `EM` (Deep Research),
  - `SER` > `PassAll@k` (Dry Experiments),
  - `RV` > `MCA` (Experimental Reasoning).
- A potential caveat is that several metrics rely on **LLM judges** (SLA, RV, and subjective idea comparisons), which introduces evaluation-model dependence; the paper mitigates this partially for idea generation via multiple judges and multiple votes, but the excerpt does not provide detailed inter-rater reliability statistics.

---

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

(From Section 6.4 plus limitations implied by the evaluation design.)

- **Partial coverage of real scientific workflows**
  - The four stages are “probes” rather than a complete representation of scientific practice (Section 6.4).
  - Topics like integration across disciplines and risk/safety assessment are noted as outside scope.

- **Deep Research scope is restricted**
  - The benchmark focuses on “literature-inquiry–centric” deep research rather than broader report writing (Section 6.4), trading realism for reproducibility.

- **Idea Generation evaluates method-design, not full hypothesis quality**
  - The benchmark focuses on structured methodological plans because open-ended hypothesis evaluation at scale is difficult (Sections 2.1.2, 6.4).

- **Limited code/action-space coverage**
  - Dry Experiment tasks support **Python** only (Section 6.4).
  - Wet Experiment action pools cover only a subset of disciplines (Section 2.4; Wet Experiments = 68 items).

- **Experimental Reasoning uses multiple-choice**
  - Multiple-choice improves automatable scoring but constrains the range of valid scientific explanations (Section 6.4).

- **Deductive bias**
  - The workflow primarily reflects a deductive paradigm starting from literature and moving toward experiments (Section 6.4), leaving inductive discovery (hypothesis emergence from novel observations) for future work.

- **TTRL optimizes novelty only**
  - The novelty reward is a gated dissimilarity score vs retrieved works (Equations (3)–(5)); optimizing novelty alone can trade off against feasibility/rigor, and the current method does not incorporate feasibility rewards in the described formulation.

---

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the landscape**
  - It reframes SGI evaluation from isolated QA into **workflow-faithful** testing aligned with a scientific inquiry cycle (PIM).
  - It introduces a practical benchmark with explicit metrics that diagnose *where* models fail (numerical aggregation, protocol sequencing, comparative multimodal reasoning).

- **Research directions suggested by the results (Section 6.3)**
  1. **Meta-analytic reasoning with numerical robustness**
     - Target the Data/Properties brittleness and the SLA–EM gap by training retrieval-conditioned quantitative reasoning and verification-aware aggregation.
  2. **Planning-aware conception**
     - Raise feasibility by enforcing parameter-complete steps, dependency consistency, and tool-augmented checks during decoding.
  3. **Scientific coding beyond syntax**
     - Address the SER–PassAll@k gap with training that emphasizes numerical stability and algorithm choice (e.g., sensitivity to discretization/integration methods).
  4. **Branch- and time-aware wet-lab reasoning**
     - Improve protocol coherence with stateful workflow verification and training signals for temporal/branch logic.
  5. **Comparative multimodal scientific reasoning**
     - Since comparative reasoning is consistently weakest (Figure 25), future training should reward precise cross-sample discrimination and extraction of quantitative cues from visuals.
  6. **Multi-objective test-time learning**
     - Extend TTRL beyond novelty to incorporate scientific rigor and feasibility rewards, preventing “novel but unusable” outputs.
  7. **Tool ecosystem optimization**
     - Since tool latency dominates (Figure 29), engineering improvements (caching, selective browsing, better extraction) can materially improve agentic SGI throughput.

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases**
  - Based on the task families, SGI-Bench-style evaluation can guide deployment decisions:
    - Use `Experimental Reasoning` metrics to choose multimodal models for interpreting scientific figures/charts.
    - Use `Dry Experiment` unit-test outcomes to assess whether a model is safe to trust for scientific code completion.
    - Use `Wet Experiment` sequence/parameter metrics to assess whether a model can draft lab protocols without hazardous omissions or ordering errors.

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (from what is described)**
  - If evaluating an agentic system, expect performance and latency to be strongly influenced by **retrieve–browse loops** and tool routing (Figure 29).
  - If optimizing idea generation without labels, the paper’s TTRL setup provides a concrete recipe (Table 8), but it should likely be paired with additional rewards if feasibility matters.
