# Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis

**ArXiv:** [2511.03773](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03773)

## 🎯 Pitch

This paper introduces DreamGym, a unified framework that trains LLM-based agents with scalable, reasoning-driven synthetic experiences—using a chain-of-thought experience model, a replay buffer grounded in offline trajectories, and curriculum task generation—to produce consistent state transitions and informative rewards for online RL. By replacing costly real-environment rollouts with controllable synthetic interactions, DreamGym makes RL feasible in non-RL-ready domains, matches costly real-rollout baselines in RL-ready settings, and provides a sample-efficient sim-to-real warm start that substantially reduces real-world interaction needs.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

DreamGym is a unified framework for training LLM-based autonomous agents with online reinforcement learning (RL) using *synthetic* interaction data, replacing expensive and brittle real-environment rollouts with a reasoning-driven “experience model” that generates state transitions and reward signals in an abstract textual state space (Figure 1, Figure 2, §4.1). It combines (i) a chain-of-thought (CoT)-guided simulator, (ii) a replay buffer grounded in offline real trajectories, and (iii) curriculum task generation driven by a reward-entropy heuristic to keep training informative (§4.1–§4.2). Empirically, it enables RL on non-RL-ready domains like WebArena and matches or improves real-environment RL baselines in RL-ready-but-costly settings, including sim-to-real warm-start gains (Table 1, Figure 3, §5.2).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem / gap addressed.**
  - RL for LLM agents is attractive because interaction can enable self-improvement beyond static pretraining, especially for multi-step tool/web/embodied tasks (§1, §2.1).
  - In practice, collecting scalable online interaction experience is blocked by four recurring bottlenecks (§1):
    1. **Costly rollouts** (long horizons, expensive steps).
    2. **Limited task diversity** (fixed instruction sets; hard to scale feasible tasks).
    3. **Unreliable reward signals** (dynamic GUIs/web; noisy or sparse feedback; false positives).
    4. **Infrastructure complexity** (heterogeneous environments; heavy backends; poor parallelism; resets/safety issues).

- **Why this is important.**
  - Many target agent settings (realistic web, OS/GUI interaction) are precisely where the above bottlenecks are worst, making “standard” online RL infeasible even if algorithms like PPO/GRPO exist (§1, §2.1, Appendix A.3).

- **Prior approaches and shortcomings (as positioned here).**
  - **Offline imitation / preference methods** like `SFT` and `DPO` can distill static trajectories but are limited by trajectory diversity/adaptivity (§2.2; Table 1 shows these are much weaker than RL-style training on the evaluated agent tasks).
  - **Synthetic data / task synthesis** efforts expand tasks or demonstrations, but many still require real-environment collection, inheriting scalability bottlenecks (§2.2).
  - **World-model / simulator approaches** attempt to emulate environments, but the paper argues that agent training need not require perfectly realistic raw-state simulation; it needs *diverse, informative, causally grounded* transitions and feedback for learning (§4.1).

- **DreamGym’s positioning.**
  - It reframes the environment as a *learning-oriented experience generator* operating in an abstract textual state space, explicitly designed to be scalable for RL training and to support curriculum and replay grounding (Figure 1, Figure 2, §4).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- DreamGym is a training framework that replaces a real interactive environment with a reasoning-based model that *synthesizes* the agent’s observations and rewards step-by-step.
- It solves scalable experience collection for online RL by generating abstract “next states,” rewards, and new tasks cheaply—so RL algorithms like `PPO` or `GRPO` can be run without (or with far fewer) costly real rollouts (§3.2, §4, §5).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Inputs:** seed tasks (instructions), some offline trajectories from the target domain, and an agent policy to train.
- **Components (Figure 2):**
  1. **Reasoning experience model (`Mexp`)**: given current abstract state + action + history + retrieved similar experiences + task instruction, it produces next abstract state and reward via explicit reasoning (§4.1.1, Eq. (4)).
  2. **Experience replay buffer**: stores offline and newly generated trajectories; retrieval provides grounding demonstrations to reduce hallucination and improve consistency (§4.1.1; Figure 2; ablated in Table 2).
  3. **Curriculum task generator (`Mtask`)**: proposes new task variations from high-value seed tasks selected using a reward-entropy / variance heuristic (§4.2, Eq. (6)–(7)).
  4. **RL trainer (PPO/GRPO)**: updates the agent policy using synthetic rollouts the same way it would use real rollouts (§3.2, §4.3).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- I first define the RL framing and what DreamGym must supply to make RL work for agent tasks (§3).
- Then I explain the experience model: abstract states, inputs/outputs, CoT reasoning, and how it is trained (§4.1, Eq. (4)–(5)).
- Next I explain replay-buffer retrieval grounding and why it matters for stability and factuality (§4.1.1; Table 2, Figure 4).
- Then I explain curriculum task generation via reward-entropy and the sampling bound `λ` (§4.2, Eq. (6)–(7)).
- Finally I connect the pipeline to training modes: fully synthetic RL vs sim-to-real warm-start, plus the provided policy improvement bound (Theorem 1, Eq. (9)) (§4.3, Appendix B.1).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

**Framing:** This is an algorithmic + systems-style paper centered on a *synthetic experience generation framework* for scalable online RL of LLM agents, with empirical evaluation across multiple environments and model backbones (§4–§6).

#### 3.4.1 RL formulation and what data RL needs

- The agent learning problem is formalized as an MDP `M = (S, A, T, R, γ, ρ0)` where `τ0` (the natural-language instruction) is part of the initial state distribution, states encode what the agent can observe, and actions are discrete UI/tool/text operations (§3.1).
- RL optimizes the policy `πθ(a|s)` to maximize expected cumulative reward using policy gradients (Eq. (1)).
- The paper focuses on `PPO` and `GRPO` as representative online RL optimizers (§3.2):
  - `PPO` uses a learned value function `V(s)` and generalized advantage estimation (GAE) (Eq. (2)).
  - `GRPO` discards the value function and normalizes rewards within a group of rollouts for the same task (Eq. (3)), aiming for scalability.
- **Key dependency:** both PPO and GRPO require a stream of (state, action, reward, next state) transitions. DreamGym’s purpose is to synthesize these transitions cheaply and consistently at scale (§4).

#### 3.4.2 The core idea: reason in an abstract textual state space (instead of raw environments)

- DreamGym builds an LLM-based **experience model** `Mexp` that operates in an abstract, meta-representational *textual* state space rather than raw HTML/pixels (§4.1).
- Concretely, for web tasks, the “state” can be a cleaned list of actionable elements (e.g., link/menuitem/table entries) rather than raw HTML; this is argued to be more token-efficient and to discard irrelevant structure (§4.1; Figure 6 shows examples of such states as numbered UI elements).
- The stated insight is that training does not require perfect raw-environment realism; it requires **diverse, informative, causally grounded** interaction data that supports knowledge acquisition for the target domain (§4.1).

#### 3.4.3 Experience rollout inference: what `Mexp` consumes and produces

DreamGym generates rollouts by alternating agent actions and experience-model transitions (Figure 2, §4.3). At step `t`:

1. **The agent** observes an abstract state `st` (plus task instruction and recent history in the prompt templates shown in Appendix C) and chooses an action `at`.
2. **The experience model** predicts:
   - the next abstract state `st+1`, and
   - the reward `rt+1`,
   using explicit chain-of-thought reasoning.

The paper identifies three additional contexts beyond `(st, at)` that improve state quality and stability (§4.1.1):

- **Interaction history** ` {(si, ai)}_{i=0..t} `, included in the context window to keep multi-turn transitions consistent (§4.1.1).
- **Task instruction** `τ`, so actions are interpreted relative to the goal (§4.1.1).
- **Retrieved past experiences** `{dj}_{j=1..k}` from a replay buffer, where retrieval uses semantic similarity of state-action embeddings:
  - `Topk(cos(ϕ(st, at), ϕ(si, ai)))` (retrieval expression in §4.1.1).
  - `ϕ(·)` is “an arbitrary semantic encoder” (not further specified in the provided content).

Given these, the transition is modeled as (Eq. (4)):

> `(st+1, rt+1) = Mexp(Rt | {(si, ai)}_{i=0..t}, {dj}_{j=1..k}, τ)`

where `Rt` is an explicit reasoning trace that guides prediction.

**Reward design used in experiments.**
- The paper uses an **outcome-based reward**: `r = 1` only at the final step if the task succeeds, and `r = 0` otherwise (§4.1.1).  
- This is important because it implies DreamGym’s gains are not from dense hand-shaped rewards; they come from (i) better transition quality and (ii) curriculum/task diversity while still operating under sparse terminal rewards.

#### 3.4.4 Training the experience model to “reason” (SFT objective with reasoning traces)

- `Mexp` is trained from an offline trajectory dataset `D = {(st, at, st+1, rt+1)}` (§4.1.2).
- Each transition is augmented with a teacher-generated reasoning trace `R*t` (prompt examples in Appendix C.1–C.3).
- The experience model is then supervised fine-tuned (SFT) with a joint objective that:
  1. learns to generate the reasoning trace, and
  2. predicts the next state conditioned on the reasoning trace (Eq. (5)):

> `LSFT = E[...] [ -log Pθ(R*t | st, at, Ht, Dk)  -log Pθ(st+1 | st, at, R*t, Ht, Dk) ]`

where `Ht` is interaction history and `Dk` the retrieved top-`k` demonstrations (§4.1.2).

**Mechanistic interpretation (why the two terms matter).**
- The first term trains the model to produce a causal explanation of why an action leads to an outcome in context; the second term uses that explanation as a scaffold to generate a coherent, informative next observation (§4.1.2).
- This design is later supported by ablations showing that removing reasoning degrades informativeness and hallucination behavior (Figure 4; Table 2).

**Data efficiency claims grounded in provided experiments.**
- For WebShop and ALFWorld, the offline datasets used to train `Mexp` include a mix of demonstrations and additional trajectories from oracle/random exploration (Appendix A.1, A.2).
- For WebArena, offline trajectories are mined from successful public leaderboard agents plus additional high-performing and random trajectories, totaling 4,800 offline trajectories (Appendix A.3).
- The paper explicitly investigates varying offline data sizes (2k/10k/20k/40k transition steps) and shows performance scaling trends of the experience model (Figure 5), though exact numeric values are only partially specified in text (see §5 below for careful reporting).

#### 3.4.5 Experience replay buffer: grounding and co-evolution

- DreamGym uses an **experience replay buffer** seeded with offline “real-world” trajectories and continually enriched with fresh synthetic interactions (Figure 2; §1; §4.1.1).
- Retrieval of similar experiences is used at inference time to reduce hallucination and improve factuality/consistency in generated states (§4.1.1).
- The buffer co-evolves with the policy: as the agent changes, new rollouts are added, and retrieval provides policy-aligned context, which is argued to stabilize training (§1; §4).

**Empirical role:** Removing replay reduces success rates in both WebShop and WebArena (Table 2; see §5.3 below).

#### 3.4.6 Curriculum task generation via reward-entropy (variance) heuristic

DreamGym addresses task scarcity by generating new tasks online (§4.2).

- Task variations are generated from a set of `m` seed tasks using:
  - `τt = Mtask({τ^{i}_{t-1}}_{i=1..m})` (Eq. (6)),
  - where `Mtask` shares parameters with `Mexp` (§4.2).

**How does it choose which tasks to expand?**
- It defines a per-task “value” based on **group-based reward entropy**, operationalized as reward variance across `n` rollouts (Eq. (7)):

> `Vτ = (1/n) Σ_i (ri - r̄)^2`, with `r̄ = (1/n) Σ_i ri`

- Interpretation given in §4.2:
  - If variance is non-zero, the agent sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails: the task is feasible but challenging.
  - Maximum “entropy” is when successes and failures are balanced, providing high information gain for credit assignment.
- This selection rule is compatible with both GRPO (groups naturally exist as multiple rollouts per task) and PPO (groups can be formed by clustering tasks using a semantic embedder) (§4.2).

**Stability control:** A hyperparameter `λ` bounds the proportion of synthetic tasks sampled per iteration to preserve coverage of the original task distribution while focusing on current weaknesses (§4.2).  
- The provided excerpt does not specify the numeric value(s) of `λ`; it only defines its role.

#### 3.4.7 End-to-end training loop: what happens first, second, third (explicit flow)

Putting the pieces together (Figure 2; §4.3):

1. **Initialize** with a seed task set and an offline-seeded replay buffer (§4.3; Figure 2).
2. **Roll out** trajectories:
   - For each task, the agent selects actions from current abstract states.
   - After each action, `Mexp` generates the next abstract state and reward using history + task + retrieved demonstrations + reasoning (Eq. (4)).
3. **Update** the agent with a standard RL algorithm (PPO or GRPO) using the collected synthetic transitions (§3.2, §4.3).
4. **Augment** the replay buffer with newly generated trajectories (Figure 2).
5. **Expand** the task set:
   - Identify high-entropy (high-variance) tasks.
   - Generate task variations with `Mtask` to create an adaptive curriculum (Eq. (6)–(7)).
6. **Repeat** until convergence or a training budget is reached (§4.3).

#### 3.4.8 Sim-to-real (S2R) extension and state-space consistency

- DreamGym-S2R trains a policy first in DreamGym’s synthetic environment, then continues RL in the real environment with far fewer real interactions (§4.3, Table 1).
- To transfer, it enforces **consistent state space** between synthetic and real environments using the same rule-based mapping or a lightweight fine-tuned model (§4.3).
  - In WebArena, an AX-tree refinement/mapping prompt is provided (Appendix C.3, “AX-tree state mapping prompt”), illustrating how raw accessibility-tree observations are reduced to a focused abstract observation.

#### 3.4.9 Theoretical policy improvement bound (why synthetic training can help real performance)

Appendix B.1 provides a trust-region-style bound (Theorem 1, Eq. (9)):

- Define one-step experience-model errors:
  - `εR = sup_{s,a} |R(s,a) - R̂(s,a)|` (reward error),
  - `εP = sup_{s,a} TV(P(·|s,a), P̂(·|s,a))` (transition distribution error),
  where `TV` is total variation distance (Eq. (8)).
- Under a KL-bounded policy update `sup_s KL(π'(·|s) || π(·|s)) ≤ δ` (linked to PPO/GRPO-style constraints), the improvement in the **real** environment is lower bounded by:
  - a synthetic surrogate improvement term (advantage under synthetic MDP),
  - minus a trust-region penalty (scales with `δ`),
  - minus an experience-model error penalty (scales with `εR`, `εP`) (Eq. (9)).

**Key implication grounded in the text:** the bound depends on reward accuracy and domain consistency, not strict raw-state reconstruction error (Appendix B.1, Lemma 1 / Eq. (14)–(26)), aligning with the paper’s “learning-centric” simulator design (§4.1).

#### 3.4.10 Worked micro-example (single input → output walk-through)

Using the WebArena case study (Figure 6):

- **Task (instruction):** “What is the message Jack provided in the first commit of Apr 2023?” (Figure 6).
- **State 0:** abstract element list includes a “Total Commits” stat badge and an “Open Change Log” button among other UI elements (Figure 6).
- **Agent action:** `Click(463)` where `[463]` corresponds to “Total Commits” (Figure 6).
- **Experience-model reasoning (`<think>`):**
  - It interprets the click as intended navigation to commit history and predicts the page should display a list of commits including April 2023 entries (Figure 6).
- **Predicted next state (State 1):**
  - A list grouping commit history by date appears, with list items for Apr 2, Apr 3, Apr 7, Apr 8, etc. (Figure 6).
- **Next agent action:** `Click(1144)` selecting the first April commit entry (Apr 2, 2023) (Figure 6).
- **Predicted next state (State 2):**
  - A commit detail view appears including message `"Add API migration notes"` (Figure 6).
- **Outcome:** This trajectory illustrates the intended causal linkage “click → history list → click commit → details,” and shows the abstract state representation (numbered actionable elements + descriptions) that DreamGym uses instead of raw webpages (Figure 6; §4.1).

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

- **(1) Reasoning-based experience synthesis as an RL-ready “environment.”**
  - Novelty: Instead of simulating raw environments, DreamGym synthesizes transitions in an abstract textual state space with explicit reasoning traces (Eq. (4)–(5), §4.1).
  - Significance: This targets the practical RL bottleneck—experience collection—by making rollouts cheap, controllable, and scalable (Figure 1; §1; §5.2).

- **(2) Retrieval-grounded multi-turn experience model with co-evolving replay.**
  - Novelty: At inference time, `Mexp` conditions not just on current state/action but also on history, task instruction, and top-`k` retrieved demonstrations (retrieval rule in §4.1.1).
  - Significance: Ablations show replay removal reduces success rates (Table 2), and evaluation suggests history/reasoning reduce inconsistencies and hallucinations (Figure 4).

- **(3) Reward-entropy (variance) driven curriculum task generation.**
  - Novelty: Task selection uses a group-based reward variance heuristic (Eq. (7)) to identify tasks that are feasible yet challenging, then generates variations (Eq. (6), §4.2).
  - Significance: Removing task generation causes notable performance drops and earlier plateaus (Table 2; §6.2; Figure 3 Right discussion in §6.2).

- **(4) Sim-to-real warm-start strategy for sample efficiency.**
  - Novelty: DreamGym-S2R trains purely synthetically first, then performs a small real-environment RL phase, with explicit attention to consistent state representations (§4.3).
  - Significance: It yields large gains with far fewer real interactions in reported experiments (Table 1; §5.2).

- **(5) Learning-centric theoretical guarantee (trust-region bound).**
  - Novelty: Theorem 1 (Appendix B.1) emphasizes that reward accuracy and transition distribution consistency control real-environment improvement, not pixel/HTML reconstruction fidelity.
  - Significance: This formalizes the paper’s core design stance in §4.1 that “perfect realism” is unnecessary if learning-relevant signals are preserved.

### 5.2 Main quantitative results (with specific numbers)

**Table 1 (success rate %, best bolded in table):**

- **WebArena (non-RL-ready; strongest relative gains):**
  - `GRPO Traditional` (80K real): 7.3 / 6.1 / 6.1 (L3.2-3B / L3.1-8B / Q2.5-7B).
  - `PPO Traditional` (80K real): 6.7 / 4.8 / 7.3.
  - `DreamGym GRPO` (0 real): **13.3 / 9.1 / 12.7**.
  - `DreamGym PPO` (0 real): **14.5 / 10.9 / 10.0**.
  - `DreamGym-S2R` (5K real) results are mixed vs pure DreamGym on WebArena:
    - GRPO S2R: 13.9 / 9.7 / 11.2
    - PPO S2R: 13.3 / 10.9 / 13.9
  - Interpretation grounded in §5.2: DreamGym makes RL feasible where real-environment RL is bottlenecked by infrastructure and reward instability.

- **WebShop (RL-ready but costly):**
  - `GRPO Traditional` (80K real): 62.1 / 65.0 / 66.1.
  - `DreamGym GRPO` (0 real): 59.3 / 63.9 / 68.3 (comparable, sometimes higher).
  - `PPO Traditional` (80K real): 59.9 / 64.2 / 68.1.
  - `DreamGym PPO` (0 real): 60.5 / 58.1 / 65.0.
  - `DreamGym-S2R` (5K real) improves substantially:
    - GRPO S2R: **70.5 / 75.0 / 72.1**
    - PPO S2R: **66.0 / 63.9 / 73.7**
  - This supports the warm-start claim in §5.2: a synthetic mid-training stage improves sample efficiency and attainable performance.

- **ALFWorld (RL-ready):**
  - `GRPO Traditional` (80K real): 65.3 / 70.9 / 79.8.
  - `DreamGym GRPO` (0 real): 62.1 / 66.3 / 71.0.
  - `DreamGym-S2R GRPO` (5K real): 65.0 / **75.9** / **82.4**.
  - `PPO Traditional` (80K real): 47.0 / 72.9 / 81.1.
  - `DreamGym PPO` (0 real): 40.5 / 70.8 / 72.7.
  - `DreamGym-S2R PPO` (5K real): 49.1 / 73.3 / 79.9.

**Offline methods (Table 1) are much lower** across tasks, especially WebArena (e.g., SFT 6.1/5.5/7.3; DPO 5.5/4.8/4.8), highlighting the gap DreamGym targets: getting RL-style improvement without needing scalable real-environment rollouts.

### 5.3 Ablations and supporting analyses

- **Component ablation (Table 2, success rate %):**
  - Full `DreamGym`: WebShop 63.9, WebArena 13.3.
  - `w/o Exp. Replay`: WebShop 59.2, WebArena 9.7.
  - `w/o Exp. Reasoning`: WebShop 55.8, WebArena 7.3.
  - `w/o Task Generation`: WebShop 57.3, WebArena 7.3.
  - Takeaway: reasoning and task generation are particularly important for WebArena (both drop to 7.3), aligning with claims about reward/task sparsity in non-RL-ready domains (§6.2–§6.3).

- **Experience model quality metrics (Figure 4):**
  - The paper evaluates consistency, diversity, informativeness, and hallucination using GPT-4o as a judge with discrete scores in `{0,1,2}` (Figure 4; Appendix C.4).
  - Reported qualitative findings (§6.3):
    - Removing history reduces consistency.
    - Removing reasoning hurts informativeness and increases hallucination.
    - Full DreamGym is best or near-best across criteria.

- **Offline data size and backbone sensitivity (Figure 5; §6.4):**
  - The paper claims high data efficiency: “Even with 2k–10k offline samples, it already reaches competitive performance” (§6.4).
  - It gives one concrete numeric anchor in text:
    - On WebShop, `Llama-3.1-8B` exceeds **50%** success with **10k** samples (§6.4).
    - `Llama-3.2-3B` reaches “about **55%**” success on WebShop with **20k** samples (§6.4).
    - On WebArena, `WebDreamer` achieves “around **13%**” success in the low-data regime (§6.4).
  - Beyond those, the figure shows trends but the excerpt does not provide exact datapoints for every curve; I avoid inventing additional numbers.

### 5.4 Do the experiments support the claims?

- **Claim: RL becomes feasible on non-RL-ready WebArena.** Supported by Table 1 where DreamGym (0 real) roughly doubles WebArena success rates compared to “Traditional” RL with 80K real transitions, across backbones (Table 1; §5.2). The infrastructure bottleneck is explicitly described in Appendix A.3 (only 4 parallel sessions; manual resets; noisy evaluation), strengthening motivation for a synthetic alternative.
- **Claim: Synthetic RL can match real RL on RL-ready tasks.** Supported by WebShop/ALFWorld comparisons where DreamGym (0 real) is close to traditional PPO/GRPO with 80K real transitions, and DreamGym-S2R improves further (Table 1; §5.2).
- **Claim: Curriculum and reasoning matter.** Supported by Table 2 and Figure 4, plus training-curve discussion that removing task generation leads to earlier plateau on WebShop (Figure 3 Right referenced in §6.2).

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Dependence on offline trajectories and teacher-generated reasoning traces.**
  - `Mexp` training requires offline transition data plus reasoning annotations `R*t` generated by a “strong teacher LLM” (Appendix A.1–A.3; §4.1.2). This introduces:
    - cost/complexity in dataset construction,
    - potential annotation bias (not analyzed quantitatively in the provided excerpt).

- **Reward scheme remains sparse in experiments.**
  - The paper uses outcome-only terminal rewards (`r=1` on success else `0`) (§4.1.1). While this keeps the reward simple, it means improvements must come from better experience/task synthesis rather than richer reward shaping. A trade-off is that some domains might need intermediate feedback to learn efficiently; the framework’s ability to incorporate richer reward signals is asserted (e.g., “rich feedback signals” in §4) but not numerically explored here.

- **State abstraction / mapping risk.**
  - DreamGym relies on an abstract textual state space and mapping functions (e.g., AX-tree refinement in WebArena; Appendix C.3; §4.3). If the abstraction drops crucial information, policies might learn shortcuts that do not transfer.
  - The paper itself notes transfer limits when domain gaps are large: policies transfer between web domains (WebShop ↔ WebArena) better than from web to embodied ALFWorld (Figure 3 Middle; §5.2).

- **Simulator factuality and hallucination are managed but not eliminated.**
  - Retrieval grounding and reasoning are explicitly motivated as hallucination reducers (§4.1.1, §6.3), and Figure 4 evaluates hallucination behavior via an LLM judge. However:
    - The judge itself is another model (GPT-4o) (Figure 4; Appendix C.4), and the excerpt does not report human evaluation or error analysis of judge reliability.

- **Incomplete reporting of low-level training hyperparameters in the provided content.**
  - The excerpt references “standard” settings and Appendix A for detailed parameter settings (§5.1), but does not include optimizer, learning rate schedule, batch size, context window, etc. This limits reproducibility assessment based solely on the provided content.

- **Single-environment focus (explicit limitation).**
  - The “Limitations and Future Work” section notes the work “primarily investigates single-environment learning setups” and suggests extending to a universal world model that unifies multiple environments (Limitations and Future Work section).

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **Field-level implication: environments as learning-centric experience generators.**
  - DreamGym pushes a perspective shift: for training general-purpose agents, the bottleneck is the *quality/structure of interaction data*, not necessarily perfect environment fidelity (§7; Appendix B.1). This can influence how future benchmarks and RL infrastructure are designed—toward scalable, abstract, controllable training interfaces.

- **Practical applications / use cases suggested by results.**
  - **Non-RL-ready domains (e.g., realistic web interaction):** DreamGym can enable RL training where real rollouts are too costly or operationally brittle (WebArena; Table 1; Appendix A.3).
  - **Costly RL-ready domains:** DreamGym can reduce reliance on real interactions while maintaining performance (WebShop, ALFWorld; Table 1).
  - **Warm-start for real-environment RL:** DreamGym-S2R provides a recipe: synthetic pretraining for exploration/skills, then limited real RL for grounding, yielding higher final success with far fewer real transitions (Table 1; §4.3; §5.2).

- **Follow-up research directions directly suggested in the paper.**
  - **Universal / multi-environment experience models:** Extend from per-environment `Mexp` to a unified model enabling cross-environment knowledge transfer (Limitations and Future Work section).
  - **Better abstractions and transfer:** Since web↔embodied transfer degrades when the domain gap is large (Figure 3 Middle; §5.2), a concrete direction is improving the meta-representation/state abstraction so it supports broader transfer.
  - **More robust reward and evaluation modeling:** The theoretical bound emphasizes reward accuracy (`εR`) and transition consistency (`εP`) (Appendix B.1). Future work could focus on measuring/controlling these quantities in practice.

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (when to prefer DreamGym, based on provided evidence).**
  - Prefer **DreamGym (pure synthetic RL)** when:
    - the environment is not RL-ready (reset/safety/throughput issues) as described for WebArena (Appendix A.3), and you still want RL-style policy improvement (Table 1).
  - Prefer **DreamGym-S2R** when:
    - you can afford a small amount of real interaction and want higher final performance and sample efficiency (Table 1; §5.2).
  - DreamGym is described as **orthogonal to the RL algorithm** (PPO vs GRPO) because it focuses on scaling experience synthesis (end of §3.2). Empirically, both PPO and GRPO benefit in the reported setups (Table 1).
