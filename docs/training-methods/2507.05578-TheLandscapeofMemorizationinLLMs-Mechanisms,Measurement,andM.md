# The Landscape of Memorization in LLMs: Mechanisms, Measurement, and Mitigation

**ArXiv:** [2507.05578](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05578)

## 🎯 Pitch

This paper provides a focused, technical survey and taxonomy of memorization in large language models, synthesizing definitions, detection methods, drivers (e.g., data duplication, model scale, training dynamics), and mitigation strategies across training, post-training, and inference. It matters because memorization creates concrete privacy and legal risks—like leaking PII or copyrighted content—while posing a key trade-off between removing harmful memorization and preserving useful model knowledge, guiding research and deployment decisions.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This paper is a focused survey of `memorization` in large language models (LLMs): why LLMs sometimes reproduce training data, how researchers define and measure that behavior, and what mitigations exist across training, post-training, and inference. It matters because memorization can lead to concrete privacy and legal harms (e.g., leaking `PII` or reproducing copyrighted text) while also intersecting with the practical need for models to retain useful knowledge (Abstract; Section 1; Section 7). The paper contributes a taxonomy (Figure 1) and organizes recent findings into mechanisms, measurement/detection techniques, mitigation strategies, and open research questions (Sections 2–7).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem/gap addressed.**
  - LLMs can emit `verbatim` or near-verbatim segments from their training data when prompted in certain ways, which creates privacy/security vulnerabilities and potential legal exposure (Abstract; Section 1).
  - The paper targets a specific gap: while there are broad surveys on LLM security/privacy, it argues for a *memorization-focused* synthesis that connects definitions, drivers, detection, mitigation, and risks into one landscape (Section 1).

- **Why this is important.**
  - The paper highlights privacy risks from memorization at LLM training scale: sensitive information in massive training corpora may be reproduced without consent, creating exposure of `personally identifiable information (PII)` and other confidential data (Section 1; Section 7).
  - It also frames memorization as relevant to copyright/proprietary content concerns, where models might reproduce protected text/code verbatim (Section 7).

- **Prior approaches and where they fall short (as positioned here).**
  - The paper contrasts itself with broader security/privacy surveys and with a memorization survey (Satvaty et al. [2024]) by emphasizing a deeper technical breakdown of mechanisms, evaluation methods, and privacy implications, plus “concrete research directions” (Section 1).
  - It also emphasizes that common detection methods often require either (a) knowing/possessing the target training text (for prefix extraction) or (b) relying on signals (for membership inference) that can be hard to calibrate for per-instance claims (Section 5).

- **How the paper positions itself.**
  - As a landscape map and synthesis: it organizes the space into (i) definitions, (ii) influencing factors, (iii) stage-wise dynamics (pretraining vs fine-tuning vs post-training), (iv) detection/measurement methods, (v) mitigation methods, and (vi) privacy/legal risks (Figure 1; Sections 2–7).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The “system” here is a **survey framework**: a structured way to categorize and reason about memorization in LLMs rather than a new model or algorithm.  
- It solves the problem of *conceptual and methodological fragmentation* by laying out a taxonomy (Figure 1) and walking through definitions, causal factors, detection tools, and mitigation strategies across the LLM lifecycle (Sections 2–7).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Box 1: Definitions of memorization** → establishes what counts as memorization and how strict the notion is (Section 2).
- **Box 2: Influencing factors** → identifies training/inference variables correlated with memorization (Section 3).
- **Box 3: Stage-wise dynamics** → describes how memorization evolves during pre-training, fine-tuning, and post-training (Section 4).
- **Box 4: Detection & measurement** → catalogs attack-style and audit-style techniques (Section 5).
- **Box 5: Mitigation** → organizes countermeasures by when they are applied (training-time, post-training, inference-time) (Section 6).
- **Box 6: Privacy & legal risk layer** → links technical behavior to downstream harms and legal disputes (Section 7).

(These boxes correspond directly to the taxonomy in Figure 1.)

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- I first explain **what “memorization” means**, because the rest of the paper depends on which definition you adopt (Section 2).
- I then cover **drivers of memorization** (data duplication, model size, sequence length, tokenization, decoding), because those motivate both attacks and defenses (Section 3).
- Next I summarize **when memorization is formed or exposed** across pre-training and fine-tuning/post-training, because lifecycle stage changes the threat model and mitigation options (Section 4).
- Then I detail **how memorization is detected/measured**, because measurement tools define what we can audit and what risks we can demonstrate (Section 5).
- Finally I cover **mitigation strategies** and **risk implications**, because these determine what practitioners can do and what trade-offs remain (Sections 6–7).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is a **survey / synthesis paper** whose core idea is to treat LLM memorization as a multi-dimensional phenomenon—definition-dependent, stage-dependent, and strongly affected by data and decoding choices—and to connect measurement techniques to mitigation and real-world risk (Abstract; Figure 1; Sections 2–7).

#### 3.4.1 “Pipeline diagram in words” (what happens first, second, third…)

1. **First, the paper fixes the vocabulary and measurement targets** by listing multiple definitions of memorization, from strict verbatim string matching to influence-based notions tied to training inclusion (Section 2).
2. **Second, it enumerates variables that empirically correlate with memorization**, such as model size and training data duplication, and notes open uncertainties (Section 3).
3. **Third, it explains how memorization changes over the training lifecycle**, including pre-training dynamics like “forgetting early examples” and the role of fine-tuning and RLHF-style post-training (Section 4).
4. **Fourth, it catalogs detection methods** (prompt-based extraction, membership inference, soft prompting, divergence-style attacks) and discusses what they can/cannot prove (Section 5).
5. **Fifth, it groups mitigations by intervention time** (training-time, post-training-time, inference-time), and discusses trade-offs (Section 6).
6. **Finally, it connects the technical landscape to downstream harms and legal consequences** (PII leakage, copyright risk, and active lawsuits) (Section 7), and closes with a synthesis and open problems (Section 8 plus “Open Questions” lists in Sections 3–7).

#### 3.4.2 Core configurations / hyperparameters (required element)

- This paper does **not** introduce or train a new LLM, and it does **not** report a unified experimental setup with optimizer settings, batch size, token budgets, context window, hardware, or model architecture hyperparameters.  
- When it discusses training procedures like `DP-SGD`, it describes the mechanism conceptually (per-example gradients, clipping, Gaussian noise, privacy accountant), but it does **not** provide concrete numeric privacy budgets (e.g., specific `(ε, δ)`), clipping norms, or noise multipliers within this document (Section 6.1).

#### 3.4.3 Definitions: what counts as memorization (Section 2)

The paper emphasizes that “memorization” is not a single thing; it depends on what behavior you’re trying to measure.

- **Exact / verbatim memorization (Section 2.1).**
  - `Verbatim memorization` is when the model reproduces training text **exactly**, often linked here to duplication or overfitting (Section 2.1).
  - `Perfect memorization` is defined as an extreme: a model assigns probability only to inputs it has seen, making generation equivalent to sampling training examples uniformly (Section 2.1).
  - `Eidetic memorization` is described as: a prompt `p` causes the model to output a verbatim string `s` from training (Section 2.1).
  - `k-eidetic memorization` tightens this to strings that appear in no more than `k` training examples but remain extractable (Section 2.1).
  - `Discoverable memorization` is operationalized via a split of a training example into `prefix p` and `suffix s`, where the model reproduces `s` given `p` (Section 2.1).

  **Micro-example (illustrative, using the paper’s `p`/`s` notation):**  
  - Suppose a training example is `"Email: alice@example.com\nOrder #123...\n"` and we split it into `p = "Email: alice@"` and `s = "example.com\nOrder #123...\n"`.  
  - Under `discoverable memorization`, if prompting the model with `p` makes it output `s` exactly, the example is counted as memorized (Section 2.1’s definition structure).

- **Approximate / paraphrased memorization (Section 2.2).**
  - The paper describes `approximate memorization` as generating output that is *similar* to training text in content/structure/phrasing but not identical (Section 2.2).
  - It summarizes a detection approach based on normalized `edit distance` between generated text and a target string, compared against a chosen threshold (Section 2.2).
  - Key implication: your measured memorization rate depends on the threshold and similarity metric, so “memorization” becomes a continuum rather than binary (Section 2.2).

- **Prompt-based memorization / extraction-centric definitions (Section 2.3).**
  - `Extractable memorization` is defined as: **without training data access**, there exists a constructable prompt that makes the model generate an exact training example (Section 2.3).
  - `k-extractable memorization` is a stricter completion-style definition: given only a `k`-token prefix, the model reproduces the entire suffix verbatim (Section 2.3).
  - `(n, p)-discoverable extraction` formalizes extraction probability under repeated sampling: a string is discoverable if it appears in at least one of `n` completions with probability ≥ `p` (Section 2.3).

  **Micro-example (why (n,p) matters):**  
  - If a memorized suffix appears only 1% of the time under stochastic decoding, greedy decoding might never show it, but repeated sampling with `n` large could reveal it (Section 2.3; also connected to “Sampling Methods” in Section 3).

- **Influence-based memorization / counterfactual inclusion (Section 2.4).**
  - `Counterfactual memorization` measures how predictions change depending on whether a specific example was included in training (Section 2.4).
  - Because training a separate model per example exclusion is prohibitive, the paper notes approaches that train multiple models excluding *subsets* and then test differences (Section 2.4).

  **Micro-example (influence intuition):**  
  - If including an example makes the model’s loss on that example (or its ability to reproduce it under prefix prompting) substantially better than a model trained without it, that delta is treated as evidence of memorization under this definition (Section 2.4).

#### 3.4.4 Factors influencing memorization (Section 3)

The paper groups drivers into training-data properties, model capacity, sequence representation, and decoding choices.

- **Model parameter size correlates with increased memorization (Section 3).**
  - The paper reports a consistent trend: larger models have greater capacity to retain training data and are more vulnerable to extraction, with memorization scaling “log-linearly with model size” as described here (Section 3).
  - It also notes findings that larger LLMs memorize more rapidly during training in ways not fully explained by standard overfitting narratives (Section 3).

- **Training data duplication is a major driver (Section 3).**
  - Duplicates over-represent certain sequences, pushing the model toward regurgitation and lowering output diversity (Section 3).
  - The paper includes a concrete reported magnitude from prior work:
    > “de-duplication substantially reduces memorization … models trained on original data exhibiting a tenfold increase in memorized token generation compared to those trained on [deduplicated] datasets” (Section 3, summarizing Lee et al. [2022]).
  - It also highlights a “superlinear relationship between duplication and memorization,” where rare samples are seldom memorized (Section 3).

- **Sequence length increases memorization likelihood (Section 3).**
  - The paper reports that memorization increases logarithmically with sequence length, with verbatim reproduction probability rising “by orders of magnitude” from 50 to 950 tokens (Section 3, summarizing Carlini et al. [2023]).
  - It also connects longer prefixes to improved extraction in soft prompting approaches (Section 3; also Section 5 soft prompting discussion).

- **Tokenization matters (Section 3).**
  - Larger `BPE` vocabularies are described as increasing memorization, especially for named entities, URLs, and uncommon phrases that may collapse into single tokens (Section 3).

- **Sampling/decoding methods affect how much memorization is *revealed* (Section 3).**
  - Stochastic decoding (top-k, nucleus, temperature, randomized decoding) is described as more effective at eliciting memorized content than greedy decoding (Section 3).
  - The paper states that optimizing sampling parameters can “substantially increase memorized data extraction,” sometimes “doubling previous baselines,” and that randomized decoding can “nearly double leakage risk compared to greedy decoding” (Section 3).

- **Open uncertainties (explicitly called out).**
  - The paper flags that effects may vary across modalities (e.g., code vs prose) and that training hyperparameters’ influence is “poorly understood” (Section 3).
  - It also highlights uncertainty about temporal order: whether encountering duplicates late vs early affects memorization probability (Section 3).

#### 3.4.5 Memorization across training stages (Section 4)

The paper argues memorization is not just “overfitting”; it is shaped by training dynamics and post-training choices.

- **Pre-training dynamics and “forgetting early examples” (Section 4).**
  - Under stochastic training (data shuffling, dropout, stochastic optimization), models tend to forget early-seen examples unless revisited, hypothesized to be due to `parameter drift` (later updates overwrite earlier representations) (Section 4).
  - The paper states that memorization becomes biased toward examples encountered later in training (Section 4).
  - It also reports that later-stage checkpoints become more susceptible to memorizing rare or out-of-distribution content (Section 4).

- **Predictable transitions / scaling laws (Section 4).**
  - It summarizes work suggesting memorization follows predictable scaling laws with model size and training duration, where sequences transition from unmemorized to memorized (Section 4).

- **Fine-tuning effects (Section 4).**
  - Different fine-tuning strategies change memorization risk:
    - `Head-only fine-tuning` is described as highest risk (linked to overfitting) (Section 4).
    - `Adapter-based` fine-tuning is described as reducing memorization when parameter updates are constrained (Section 4).
  - It also notes task differences: e.g., summarization vs QA may induce different attention dynamics correlated with memorization (Section 4).
  - From an adversarial lens, the paper describes targeted fine-tuning (via “Janus Interface”) as amplifying leakage of sensitive information, framing fine-tuning as potentially reactivating latent memorization vulnerabilities (Section 4).

- **Reinforcement learning post-training (RLHF/RLVR/RLIF) (Section 4).**
  - The paper states research is limited here, and summarizes one finding in code generation: memorized data during fine-tuning persists with high frequency after RLHF, while there is “minimal evidence” that reward-model data or RL data becomes memorized (Section 4).

- **Distillation (Section 4).**
  - It suggests memorization may propagate from teacher to student during distillation but says it “has not been formally analyzed” in the context of memorization (Section 4).

#### 3.4.6 Detecting / measuring memorization (Section 5)

The paper organizes detection tools by what access an auditor/adversary has and what signal they exploit.

- **Divergence attack (Section 5).**
  - This is presented as a prompt-based extraction method intended to bypass alignment defenses in instruction-tuned LLMs by inducing behavior closer to pre-alignment decoding contexts (Section 5).
  - The paper reports a concrete magnitude:
    > “up to 150× more verbatim sequences compared to typical user queries” (Section 5, summarizing Nasr et al. [2023]).
  - Mechanism hypothesis given here: the prompt induces decoding analogous to an end-of-text token context where memorized high-likelihood continuations are favored (Section 5).

- **Prefix-based data extraction (Section 5).**
  - Query with an initial segment of a sequence and see if the model completes it verbatim or approximately (depending on definition) (Section 5).
  - Longer prefixes reduce ambiguity and increase likelihood of verbatim completion (Section 5).
  - The paper mentions “structured prefixes” (email headers, doc starts) as potent (Section 5).

- **Adversarial prefix generation (Section 5).**
  - It summarizes work where LLMs generate candidate prefixes likely to elicit private data from a target model, and notes leakage can occur even when prompts diverge from original training distribution (Section 5).

- **Membership inference attacks (MIA) (Section 5).**
  - The paper describes MIA as attempting to infer whether a specific input was in training, often using loss/likelihood/perplexity signals (Section 5).
  - It lists several techniques:
    - Raw loss thresholding (seen examples lower loss) (Section 5).
    - Reference-model calibration (subtract reference loss) (Section 5).
    - `zlib entropy` normalization (loss normalized by compressed size) (Section 5).
    - Neighborhood attack (compare loss to perturbations) (Section 5).
    - `min-k% prob` (focus on highest-loss tokens) (Section 5).
  - It emphasizes a key limitation: MIAs lack a well-calibrated null model because you cannot train an identical model without the target input, undermining per-instance false positive estimation (Section 5).
  - It notes a recommended reframing: MIAs as *aggregate-level privacy auditing* tools rather than individual proof of inclusion, and points to alternatives like extraction attacks or canary-based MIAs for stronger evidence (Section 5).

- **Soft prompting (static and dynamic) (Section 5).**
  - `Continuous soft prompts` are learned embeddings prepended to inputs, used to amplify or suppress memorization leakage (Section 5).
  - The paper provides concrete reported effects:
    > attack prompts increased leakage “by up to 9.3%,” while suppress prompts decreased extraction “by up to 97.7%” (Section 5, summarizing Ozdayi et al. [2023]).
  - It summarizes ProPILE as a white-box privacy auditing framework using soft prompt tuning to extract PII, noting transferability across models (Section 5).
  - `Dynamic soft prompting` (prefix-conditioned) adapts prompts to the input prefix and is reported to increase discoverable memorization rates vs static/no prompt baselines (Section 5).

- **Reasoning-focused memorization (Section 5).**
  - The paper notes that most memorization definitions are “reproduce the datapoint” style; for reasoning models, it suggests measuring whether models fail on “hard perturbations” that require different reasoning despite superficial similarity (Section 5).
  - It positions benchmark creation for “superficial reasoning pattern” memorization as open (Section 5).

#### 3.4.7 Mitigation strategies (Section 6)

The paper groups mitigations by *when* they act and emphasizes trade-offs.

- **Training-time interventions (Section 6.1).**
  - `Data cleaning / de-duplication`: reduces exposure to overrepresented sequences and serves as implicit regularization (Section 6.1).
  - `PII-scrubbing`: removing rare sensitive sequences reduces the need for the model to memorize them to minimize loss (Section 6.1).
  - `Differential privacy (DP)` via `DP-SGD`:
    - Mechanism described: per-example gradients → norm clipping → add calibrated Gaussian noise → privacy accountant tracks cumulative loss under `(ε, δ)` (Section 6.1).
    - The paper describes DP as providing robust protection against membership inference and extraction attacks, and mentions empirical validation via canary insertion and MIAs (Section 6.1).
  - `CRT (Confidentially Redacted Training)`: combines de-duplication, redaction, and DP-SGD to avoid retention of sensitive content while maintaining competitive perplexity (Section 6.1).
  - DP trade-offs: strict privacy budgets can degrade performance and add computational overhead, challenging scaling (Section 6.1).
  - `DP + PEFT` (e.g., LoRA/adapters):
    - Hypothesized to need less noise due to fewer trained parameters, improving utility (Section 6.1).
    - But the paper also notes a concern: concentrating noise in a narrow subset could weaken privacy protection (Section 6.1).
  - `User-level DP` vs record-level DP:
    - The paper reports canary-based evaluation showing user-level DP yields “much lower canary extraction rates” than record-level DP (Section 6.1).

- **Post-training interventions (Section 6.2).**
  - `Machine unlearning` aims to remove influence of certain examples so behavior matches a model that never saw them (Section 6.2).
  - The paper reports approximate unlearning methods can be “over 10^5× more computationally efficient” than retraining, but lack formal guarantees (Section 6.2).
  - `ParaPO`:
    - Procedure as described: identify memorized pretraining sequences via prefix→near-exact suffix decoding; create preference pairs by summarizing memorized datapoints using a separate LLM; post-train with `DPO` preferring the summary over verbatim memorized sequence (Section 6.2).
    - It reports a trade-off: decreased unintended memorization while preserving verbatim recall of desired sequences (e.g., direct quotations), but slightly decreased utility on math/knowledge/reasoning benchmarks (Section 6.2).

- **Inference-time interventions (Section 6.3).**
  - `MemFree decoding`:
    - Uses a bloom filter representing all training-set `n-grams` to detect and filter memorized sequences during generation (Section 6.3).
    - Limitations noted: near-identical n-grams evade detection; it requires access to training n-gram data (Section 6.3).
  - `Activation steering`:
    - Manipulates internal activations to suppress memorized sequences while aiming to preserve overall performance (Section 6.3).
    - The paper reports “up to 60%” reduction in memorization with minimal performance degradation, but sensitivity to layer choice and steering strength (Section 6.3).
  - `Localization / pruning-based removal`:
    - The paper summarizes mechanistic findings that memorization can be localized to specific components (Section 6.3).
    - It reports one result:
      > pruning-based `Hard Concrete` identifies fewer than “0.5% of neurons” whose removal causes a “60% drop in memorization accuracy” (Section 6.3, summarizing Chang et al. [2023]).
    - It flags “collateral forgetting”: neurons for one memory may contribute to others, complicating targeted interventions (Section 6.3).

- **Connections to other undesirable behaviors (Section 6.4).**
  - The paper explicitly says it remains open whether reducing memorization also reduces hallucination, bias, or toxicity; it has not seen cross-cutting analysis on this (Section 6.4).

#### 3.4.8 Privacy & legal risks (Section 7)

- **Personal data leakage** is framed as a direct harm: leaking PII could enable identity theft and regulatory consequences in sensitive industries (Section 7).
- **Copyright/proprietary content reproduction** is highlighted as a risk, including examples discussed in the context of known open datasets and regurgitation of book text (Section 7).
- **Legal landscape**: the paper lists multiple lawsuits and positions memorization as central to claims about unauthorized reproduction and competition with copyrighted sources (Section 7).

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

(As a survey, the “innovations” are primarily *organizational and integrative* rather than a single new algorithm.)

- **A unified taxonomy spanning definitions → drivers → detection → mitigation → risk.**
  - Figure 1 provides a compact map that connects technical measurement choices to downstream harms and countermeasures, clarifying that “memorization” is definition- and method-dependent (Figure 1; Sections 2–7).

- **Clarifying that detection tools have different evidentiary strength.**
  - The paper draws a sharp distinction between extraction-style evidence (can produce leaked text) and membership inference signals that may not be statistically sound for per-instance claims due to null-model/calibration issues (Section 5).

- **Stage-wise framing of memorization as a lifecycle phenomenon.**
  - By separately treating pre-training dynamics (forgetting/parameter drift), fine-tuning (method-dependent memorization risk), and post-training RL (limited evidence of new memorization but persistence of prior memorization), the paper encourages mitigation to be tailored to where the risk arises (Section 4).

- **Mitigation as a “time of intervention” design space with explicit trade-offs.**
  - Training-time (`dedup`, `DP-SGD`, `CRT`), post-training (`unlearning`, `ParaPO`), and inference-time (`MemFree`, `activation steering`) are compared as categories with different scalability/guarantee profiles (Section 6).

- **Explicit open-question lists as a research agenda.**
  - The paper repeatedly enumerates open questions (Sections 3–7), making the landscape actionable for follow-up work rather than only descriptive.

## 5. Experimental Analysis

- **Evaluation methodology (what this paper itself does).**
  - This paper does **not** present a new experimental benchmark with controlled training runs; it synthesizes reported empirical results from many cited works (Abstract; Sections 3–6).
  - Therefore, there is no single dataset/metric/baseline stack used consistently throughout this paper.

- **Main quantitative results reported (as summarized from prior work).**
  - Divergence attack yields:
    > “up to 150× more verbatim sequences” than typical user queries (Section 5).
  - De-duplication effect:
    > “tenfold increase in memorized token generation” in non-deduplicated vs deduplicated training (Section 3).
  - Soft prompt control:
    > +“up to 9.3%” leakage increase with attack prompts; “up to 97.7%” extraction decrease with suppress prompts (Section 5).
  - Approximate unlearning efficiency:
    > “over 10^5× more computationally efficient than retraining” (Section 6.2).
  - Activation steering reduction:
    > “up to 60%” reduction in memorization with minimal performance degradation (Section 6.3).
  - Neuron-level pruning/localization:
    > fewer than “0.5% of neurons” removed causes a “60% drop in memorization accuracy” (Section 6.3).

- **Do experiments convincingly support claims (as presented here)?**
  - The paper’s strongest support is *pluralistic*: multiple independent works are cited to support correlations (model size, duplication, decoding) and the feasibility of extraction and mitigation approaches (Sections 3, 5, 6).
  - However, because the survey does not normalize across threat models, datasets, or definitions, the evidence base is best interpreted as “these effects occur under some settings,” not as a single quantified law applicable everywhere (implicit in the paper’s repeated emphasis on definition dependence and open questions; Sections 2–3, 5).

- **Ablations/failure cases/robustness checks mentioned.**
  - The paper highlights methodological critique/robustness issues for MIAs, focusing on calibration and false-positive interpretability (Section 5).
  - It also discusses limitations/failure modes for mitigations like MemFree (near-duplicate evasion; needs training n-grams) and activation steering (sensitivity to layer/strength; collateral forgetting) (Section 6.3).

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Survey limitation: no unified operationalization.**
  - The paper covers many definitions (exact, approximate, extractable, influence-based), but does not propose a single standard metric that reconciles them (Section 2). This reflects the field’s fragmentation rather than a flaw, but it limits direct comparability.

- **Dependence on access assumptions.**
  - Several detection methods assume access to training data or at least to candidate prefixes/suffixes, while the paper itself notes the need for methods that detect memorization without training data access (Section 5, open question #1 there).

- **MIA interpretability limitations.**
  - The paper emphasizes that MIAs cannot reliably prove per-instance inclusion due to lack of a calibrated null model, which constrains how MIAs should be used in practice (Section 5).

- **Mitigation trade-offs: guarantees vs scalability vs utility.**
  - `DP-SGD` offers formal guarantees but is described as challenging to scale due to utility and computational overhead trade-offs (Section 6.1).
  - Post-training unlearning can be efficient but lacks formal guarantees that memorization is truly removed (Section 6.2).
  - ParaPO reduces verbatim reproduction but is reported to slightly reduce benchmark utility on math/knowledge/reasoning (Section 6.2).
  - Inference-time filters/steering can help but have evasion/sensitivity issues and may risk collateral forgetting when localized components overlap across memories (Section 6.3).

- **Open empirical gaps explicitly identified.**
  - Modality dependence (code vs prose), temporal order effects during training, how to design decoding methods that minimize leakage across scenarios, and how to distinguish generalization from memorization (Section 3 “Open Questions”).
  - Whether memorization scaling laws transfer to domain-specific fine-tuning, and how to attribute memorization to pretraining vs fine-tuning (Section 4 “Open Questions”).
  - How to benchmark and detect “reasoning pattern memorization” in reasoning models (Section 5 “Open Questions”).

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the landscape (within the scope of this paper).**
  - It reframes memorization as a *multi-axis design and auditing problem*: what you conclude depends on definition (Section 2), model/data/decoding choices (Section 3), and lifecycle stage (Section 4), and those choices connect directly to the feasibility of extraction and mitigation (Sections 5–6).
  - It also elevates memorization from a purely technical curiosity to a driver of privacy harm and legal exposure (Section 7).

- **Follow-up research it enables/suggests (as enumerated by the paper).**
  - Detection without training data access (Section 5 open question #1).
  - Decoding methods explicitly designed to minimize leakage (Section 3 open question #2).
  - Understanding why larger LLMs memorize more (mechanistic/optimization explanations) (Section 3 open question #3).
  - Distinguishing generalization from memorization (Section 3 open question #4).
  - Stage attribution: quantifying pretraining vs fine-tuning contributions (Section 4 open question #3).
  - Distillation pathways: whether and how memorization transfers teacher→student (Section 4 open question #5).
  - Reasoning-model benchmarks for superficial pattern memorization (Section 5 open question #4).
  - Cross-cutting impact: whether memorization mitigation reduces hallucination/bias/toxicity (Section 6.4; Section 6 open question #8).

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases.**
  - **Privacy auditing** for model release or deployment: use extraction-style evaluations and aggregate-level MIAs where appropriate, acknowledging per-instance limitations (Section 5).
  - **Dataset governance**: prioritize de-duplication and sensitive-data scrubbing as baseline hygiene (Section 6.1).
  - **Safety/privacy post-training**: explore methods like ParaPO when the goal is to reduce verbatim reproduction while keeping some types of recall (Section 6.2).
  - **Operational defenses**: inference-time strategies (filters, activation steering) can be used as wrappers or controls, but must be evaluated for evasion and utility impact (Section 6.3).

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (when to prefer what, based on this paper).**
  - Prefer **data cleaning (de-duplication + scrubbing)** as a default first-line mitigation because it reduces overrepresented sequences before they can be learned (Section 6.1).
  - Prefer **DP-style training** when formal privacy guarantees are required, but anticipate compute/utility trade-offs and scaling challenges noted here (Section 6.1).
  - Prefer **post-training approaches** (unlearning, ParaPO) when you must target already-trained models or selectively reduce specific memorized content, recognizing the paper’s stated limits: lack of formal guarantees for unlearning and some utility degradation for ParaPO (Section 6.2).
  - Prefer **inference-time interventions** (MemFree, activation steering) when you need deploy-time controls without retraining, while accounting for the paper’s limitations: needing training n-gram access (MemFree) and sensitivity/collateral effects (steering/localization) (Section 6.3).
