# Insight Miner: A Time Series Analysis Dataset for Cross-Domain Alignment with Natural Language

**ArXiv:** [2512.11251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11251)

## 🎯 Pitch

The paper introduces Insight Miner, an instruction-tuned large multimodal model trained on TS-Insights — a 100k sample dataset of time-series windows paired with GPT-generated, analysis-oriented descriptions produced via a tool-using decomposition pipeline. This approach enables models to generate faithful, domain-aware natural-language trend insights from raw time series, lowering the expertise barrier for temporal-data interpretation and improving generalization on unseen datasets compared to baseline multimodal and feature-engineered GPT-4 systems.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

`Insight Miner` is a time-series-to-language system that instruction-tunes a large multimodal model to generate natural-language trend descriptions (i.e., “insights”) directly from time-series windows, lowering the domain expertise barrier for interpreting temporal data. The work’s main enabling artifact is `TS-Insights`, a large dataset of time-series windows paired with GPT-generated analysis-oriented descriptions, constructed via a tool-using pipeline that decomposes and smooths time series before prompting GPT-4 (Section 2, Figure 1). Human expert evaluation shows that the tuned model substantially improves description faithfulness over the base multimodal model and is competitive with a feature-engineered GPT-4 baseline, including stronger generalization on holdout datasets (Section 4, Figure 2).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem/gap addressed**
  - Many domains (environment, agriculture, transportation, finance) rely on time series, but turning raw time series into *interpretable* textual insights typically requires specialized expertise and manual effort (Abstract, Section 1).
  - Prior LLM-for-time-series work often targets **numerical outputs** (forecasting/classification/anomaly detection), which does not inherently produce **natural-language explanations** or “insights” about trend/seasonality/volatility (Section 1).

- **Why it matters**
  - Natural-language insight generation can make time-series analysis more accessible and can support scientific/industrial workflows where stakeholders need explanations rather than only predictions (Abstract, Section 1).

- **Prior approaches and shortcomings**
  - Classical statistical methods like `ARIMA`, `STL`, and state-space models offer interpretability but still demand domain and statistical expertise to apply/interpret (Section 1).
  - LLM-based time-series approaches:
    - Use pretrained LMs (e.g., GPT-2) or prompting to solve numerical tasks (Section 1), but they do not directly address *textual* insight generation.
  - Multimodal alignment successes exist in narrow domains (e.g., FinVis-GPT for financial charts), but there has not been a **general-domain time-series ↔ language alignment dataset** aimed at descriptive analysis (Section 1).

- **How this work positions itself**
  - It frames time series as a modality to be aligned with language (similar in spirit to vision-language alignment), and contributes:
    1) a dataset of time-series windows paired with analysis-style descriptions (`TS-Insights`), and  
    2) an instruction-tuned multimodal model (`Insight Miner`) that learns to generate such descriptions (Section 1, Section 3).

> **Note on dataset counts (ambiguity in the provided text):** The abstract says `TS-Insights` contains “100k time-series windows sampled from 20 forecasting datasets,” while Section 2.2 states “10,000 initial samples derived from 29 datasets” and Appendix A lists “20 datasets involved” with a total of 10,360 initial samples before augmentation. I treat Appendix A + the “100k total training samples” claim as the most concrete description of the released training set, and I explicitly flag the inconsistency rather than guessing a resolution.

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The system is a multimodal language model that takes a **time series window (rendered as a line-plot image)** plus an instruction and outputs a **natural-language description of the trend**.
- The solution combines (1) an **agentic/tool-using data generation pipeline** that produces aligned time-series–text pairs and (2) **instruction tuning** of a vision-language model to speak about time-series trends (Sections 2–3).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Data construction pipeline (`TS-Insights`)**: raw time-series window → statistical decomposition/smoothing/downsampling → compact numeric representation → GPT-4 generates trend text → augment/rephrase → training triples `(time series window, question, answer)` (Section 2, Figure 1, Appendix A).
- **Model (`Insight Miner`)**: time-series window → line plot image → frozen vision encoder → trainable linear projection → frozen LLM decoder conditioned on instruction → generated trend description (Section 3).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- I first explain how a single training example is defined (window + instruction + answer) because that clarifies the supervision signal (Section 2).
- I then detail the **tool-use pipeline** for extracting trend signals and why it exists (Section 2.1, Figure 1).
- Next I describe dataset scaling: sampling strategy, aggregation, augmentation, and rephrasing (Section 2.2, Appendix A).
- Finally I explain how the model consumes time series (as plots), what is trained vs frozen, and what the experimental comparisons measure (Sections 3–4).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is an **empirical dataset + system** paper whose core idea is to *manufacture high-quality time-series analysis supervision* by combining statistical feature extraction with LLM-based text synthesis, and then use that supervision to align time-series inputs with language outputs (Sections 2–3).

#### 3.4.1 What one training example looks like (instruction format)

- The dataset is built from multiple source time-series datasets `{D_i}`; from these, the pipeline samples windows `W_k` and pairs each window with a question `L^Q_k` and an answer `L^A_k` (Section 2).
- Each sample is formatted as a single-turn instruction-following example:
  - **Human:** `W_k` + question `L^Q_k`  
  - **Assistant:** answer `L^A_k`  
  (Equation (1), Section 2).
- A key practical choice is that the current workflow focuses on **single-feature windows**, i.e., `W_k ∈ R^{1×τ_k}`, to make trend/seasonality/residual concepts easier to describe and evaluate (Section 2, Figure 1).

#### 3.4.2 Why not just prompt GPT-4 with the raw time-series vector?

- A naive approach would feed GPT-4 the raw vector like `[0.52, 0.98, …]` and ask it to describe trend/seasonality/volatility, but the authors report GPT-4 fails to accurately extract these components from raw vectors (Section 2; failure cases referenced as Appendix B).
- This motivates a **tool-use pipeline** where statistical methods first extract structured components, and GPT-4 is asked to generate text from those extracted signals rather than from raw data (Section 2.1, Figure 1).

#### 3.4.3 Trend extraction pipeline (STL or GP → smoothing → downsampling)

The pipeline for producing a **trend description** for one window `W_k` proceeds as follows (Section 2.1, Figure 1):

1) **Start from a raw single-feature time series window**  
   - The window is `W_k ∈ R^{1×τ_k}` with length `τ_k`.  
   - The paper notes `τ_k` is randomly sampled from `[30, 500]` for the current dataset generation (footnote in Section 2).

2) **Extract a trend signal `T_k`**
   - **Case A: use STL decomposition**  
     - The pipeline applies `STL` (“Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LoESS”), which decomposes the series into:
       - `W_k = T_k + S_k + R_k`  
         where `T_k` is trend, `S_k` is seasonality, and `R_k` is residual/noise (Equation (2), Section 2.1).
     - The extracted trend is represented as `T_k = (ŷ_1, ŷ_2, …, ŷ_{τ_k})` (Section 2.1).
   - **Case B: no seasonality → Gaussian Process trend fit**
     - If the window “might not exhibit any seasonalities,” the pipeline instead fits a **Gaussian Process regression** to time index → value pairs and uses the posterior mean as the trend `T_k` (Section 2.1).
     - The GP setup (Section 2.1) is:
       - Mean function `µ(x) = 0`.
       - Kernel `K(x, x′) = RBF(x, x′) + σ_e^2 δ_{x,x′}` where:
         - `RBF(x, x′) = σ_r^2 exp(-(x − x′)^2 / (2γ))` (as written in the text),
         - `δ_{x,x′}` is the Kronecker delta (1 if `x=x′`, else 0),
         - the white-noise term models observation noise.
     - Kernel parameters (listed in Section 2.1) are estimated by maximizing likelihood, and the GP posterior mean at each time step becomes the extracted trend series `T_k`.

3) **Smooth the extracted trend**
   - After STL/GP produces `T_k`, the pipeline applies a **Gaussian smoothing kernel** `F_k = [F_1, …, F_{w_k}]` where `w_k` is a kernel-size hyperparameter (Section 2.1).
   - This smoothing is intended to “further smooth out the trend” before summarization (Section 2.1).

4) **Downsample to a fixed small length**
   - The pipeline downsamples using stride `s_k` and produces smoothed-downsampled values `\tilde{y}_i` via Equation (3) (Section 2.1).
   - A specific design constraint is: the stride size `s_k` is chosen so that `τ_k // s_k = 25`, i.e., the trend is reduced to **25 points** regardless of original window length (footnote in Section 2.1).

5) **Quantize and prompt GPT-4**
   - Each entry of the downsampled trend sequence `( \tilde{y}_1, …, \tilde{y}_{τ_k//s_k} )` is **rounded to one decimal place** and then fed to GPT-4 to generate a trend description (end of Section 2.1; Figure 1 shows the prompt conceptually).
   - The resulting supervised pair is: original time series window `W_k` + GPT-generated trend description (Section 2.1).

> **What is “agentic workflow” here?** In this paper’s usage, it effectively means the dataset is created by a *multi-step procedure that uses tools* (STL/GP/smoothing/downsampling) before calling an LLM (GPT-4) to produce the final natural-language label (Abstract; Section 2.1; Figure 1).

#### 3.4.4 Dataset construction and scaling to 100k samples

- **Initial sampling from forecasting archives**
  - The dataset is built from time series in the Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive (Section 2.2 references [13]).
  - Section 2.2 says the authors generate **10,000 initial samples** from **29 datasets** and hold out **11 datasets** for evaluation only.
  - Appendix A, however, lists **20 datasets** involved with a total of **10,360** initial samples across granularities (daily/hourly/monthly/etc.), which is close to the “10,000 initial samples” statement.

- **Train split usage to reduce leakage**
  - Windows are sampled only from the **train split**, defined as the **first 70% of time steps** in temporal order (Section 2.2).
  - This is a basic time-series-safe split strategy, though the paper does not describe additional contamination checks beyond this (Section 2.2).

- **Aggregation for capturing higher-level seasonality**
  - Some datasets have multiple seasonalities (e.g., daily + weekly). The paper notes that short windows may not contain enough cycles to detect higher-level seasonality (they state “at least two full cycles are required”) (Section 2.2).
  - To address this, they **aggregate multiple time steps into one** (i.e., coarsen the granularity) to produce windows with “more diversified patterns” (Section 2.2; Appendix A lists multiple granularities for some datasets, e.g., `elecdemand_dataset` at half-hourly, hourly, … daily).

- **Augmentation to expand labels cost-effectively**
  - For each GPT-4 labeled sample, they apply **nine different random augmentations** such that the same trend description remains applicable, yielding ~10× expansion (Section 2.2).
  - Appendix A lists augmentation types (each applied with probability 50%, and multiple can apply):
    - `Jittering`: add Gaussian noise where noise std is from a local rolling window of size 4.
    - `Scaling`: multiply by a constant.
    - `Shifting`: add a constant.
    - `Smoothing`: convolve with an average kernel of random size.
    - `Downsampling`: keep every other `k` steps for random integer `k`.
  - After augmentation, they reach **100k total training samples** (Section 2.2; also consistent with Abstract).

- **Language diversity via rephrasing**
  - They rephrase the GPT-4 description using `GPT-3.5-turbo` to increase linguistic variety (Section 2.2).

- **Released/evaluation subsets**
  - Appendix A notes that on HuggingFace they release ten window samples for each holdout and test dataset, but due to limited human resources the evaluation in Section 4 uses only the **first three samples from each dataset**.
  - Appendix A also states they “only saved the original time series windows but not the augmented windows,” though they can be regenerated from scripts (Appendix A).

#### 3.4.5 Model: turning time series into images and tuning only the projection

- **Base architecture**
  - The model is initialized from `LLaVA` weights and uses the same overall design: a **vision encoder** produces embeddings from an image, a **linear projection** maps those embeddings into the language embedding space, and the **language model** generates text conditioned on projected image embeddings plus the instruction (Section 3).
  - Time series are converted to images via a **line plot**; training explicitly uses the `Seaborn` lineplot function for plotting inputs to the vision pathway (Section 3; also noted in the Experiment model definitions in Section 4).

- **What is trained vs frozen**
  - To align time-series images with the LLM, they **only fine-tune the linear projection layer** while keeping both the vision encoder and the language model frozen (Section 3).
  - The training objective is to generate the GPT-labeled trend description given the plotted time series and a prompt asking for a trend description (Section 3).

- **Compute/training cost details (what is and is not specified)**
  - Hardware: training uses **8 × NVIDIA A100 40 GiB GPUs** (Section 3).
  - Time: **~1 hour per epoch** (Section 3).
  - The paper evaluates models trained for **1 epoch** and **3 epochs** (Section 4).
  - **Missing training hyperparameters:** The provided text does **not** specify optimizer type/settings, learning rate schedule, batch size, weight decay, tokenizer, context window, number of layers/hidden size/heads (beyond inheriting “same architecture as LLaVA”), or total training tokens/steps. I cannot fill these in without fabricating.

- **Naming**
  - The fine-tuned model is named `Insight Miner` (Section 3).

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

- **(1) A general-domain time-series ↔ language alignment dataset built via tool-augmented labeling**
  - The work’s most novel artifact is `TS-Insights`: pairing raw time-series windows with **analysis-style natural-language descriptions** at scale (100k samples) (Abstract; Section 2.2).
  - The distinguishing feature is the *workflow*: statistical decomposition/smoothing produces a compact trend representation, and GPT-4 turns that into text (Section 2.1; Figure 1). This is different from simply captioning pre-existing labels, because time series typically have no captions.

- **(2) “Decompose first, describe second” improves faithfulness over raw-vector prompting**
  - The pipeline explicitly addresses the reported failure mode where GPT-4 cannot reliably infer trend/seasonality from raw numeric vectors (Section 2; Appendix B referenced).
  - By giving GPT-4 a simplified, denoised, downsampled trend signal, the supervision is more likely to be consistent and learnable (Section 2.1).

- **(3) Lightweight multimodal adaptation: tune only a projection layer**
  - Instead of end-to-end fine-tuning, the approach fine-tunes only the linear projection from vision encoder outputs to the LLM embedding space (Section 3).
  - This is significant practically because it reduces training cost and enables faster iteration (8×A100, ~1 hour/epoch) while still yielding large gains over the base `LLaVA` in the target task (Sections 3–4; Figure 2).

- **(4) Evidence of cross-domain generalization to unseen datasets**
  - The evaluation includes **holdout datasets** not used in training, and the tuned model performs especially well there relative to the GPT-4 engineered baseline (Section 4; Figure 2).
  - This supports the dataset’s stated goal: general-domain alignment beyond a single domain like finance (Section 1; Section 4 discussion).

## 5. Experimental Analysis

### Evaluation methodology

- **Task evaluated**
  - Generate a **trend description** that is faithful to the original time series (Section 4).

- **Evaluation sets**
  - **119 total windows** (Section 4):
    - 69 from the test split (last 30%) of datasets used for training,
    - 50 from holdout datasets not used for training (Section 4; Appendix A lists holdout dataset families).

- **Models compared (Section 4)**
  - `LLaVA`: off-the-shelf checkpoint (HuggingFace).
  - `Vision (1 epoch)`: LLaVA fine-tuned for 1 epoch on the trend dataset (this corresponds to an `Insight Miner` variant).
  - `Vision (3 epochs)`: LLaVA fine-tuned for 3 epochs (another `Insight Miner` variant).
  - `Engineering GPT`: GPT-4 that receives extracted features as in the Section 2.1 pipeline (STL/GP trend extraction + smoothing/downsampling) rather than raw vectors.

- **Human evaluation protocol**
  - For each of the 119 samples, each model produces one description, and **three domain experts** score them (Section 4).
  - Descriptions are shuffled per sample to reduce ordering bias (Section 4).
  - Scoring rubric (Section 4):
    - 2 = matches the original time series,
    - 1 = partially correct,
    - 0 = not correct.
  - Scores are summed across evaluators and samples and normalized to produce a final **0–1 score** for test and holdout sets (Section 4).

### Main quantitative results (with the constraint that exact numbers are not provided)

- Figure 2 reports normalized human scores for each model on test vs holdout datasets (Figure 2, Section 4).
- The key outcomes described in text (Section 4) are:
  - `Vision (3 epochs)` and `Vision (1 epoch)` **significantly outperform** the base `LLaVA` model.
  - Training longer helps: `Vision (3 epochs)` performs better than `Vision (1 epoch)`.
  - `Vision (3 epochs)` is **competitive with GPT-4** (`Engineering GPT`) on the evaluated task.
  - `Vision (3 epochs)` **outperforms GPT-4 on the holdout datasets** (Section 4).

> The paper does not provide the exact numeric scores in the text, and the figure in the provided excerpt is not accompanied by a table of values, so I do not reproduce precise numbers.

### Do the experiments support the claims?

- **Supports**:
  - The comparisons directly test the central claim that instruction tuning on `TS-Insights` improves time-series description quality over an untuned multimodal baseline (`LLaVA`) (Figure 2).
  - Including holdout datasets makes the generalization claim more credible than evaluating only in-domain test splits (Section 4).

- **Weaknesses / gaps**:
  - The evaluation set is relatively small (119 windows), and Appendix A notes the evaluation used only the first three samples from each dataset due to limited human resources.
  - The paper focuses on trend descriptions only; it does not yet demonstrate seasonality/residual/volatility descriptions quantitatively (Section 2; Section 5).

### Ablations / robustness checks

- There is a light “epochs” comparison: 1 epoch vs 3 epochs (Section 4; Figure 2).
- Appendix B includes qualitative case studies comparing multiple models (Appendix B figures), but the main body does not provide systematic robustness analyses (e.g., across window sizes `τ_k`, across augmentation types, or across decomposition failure modes).

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Scope limitation: trend-only, single-feature windows**
  - The dataset generation and modeling focus on **single-feature** windows and (as a proof of concept) **trend descriptions** only (Section 2; Section 2.1).
  - Multi-feature time series and cross-feature relations (e.g., cross-correlation) are explicitly left as future work (Section 5).

- **Dependence on synthetic labels and pipeline assumptions**
  - Labels come from GPT-4 prompted with processed signals, so the supervision quality is bounded by:
    - correctness of STL/GP trend extraction,
    - the choice to downsample to 25 points and round to one decimal,
    - GPT-4’s reliability in turning those values into accurate text (Section 2.1).
  - If the decomposition or GP fit is poor, the generated description may systematically encode errors.

- **Potential mismatch: time series are treated as images**
  - The model ingests time series as **plots**, leveraging a pretrained vision encoder (Section 3). This is pragmatic, but it discards precise numeric structure and may be sensitive to plotting choices (axes scaling, resolution, style), which the paper does not analyze.

- **Incomplete reporting of training details**
  - Important hyperparameters (optimizer, LR schedule, batch size, etc.) are not included in the provided text, making reproduction of training dynamics harder (Section 3).

- **Evaluation limitations**
  - Human scoring is valuable for insight quality, but the evaluation size is small (119 windows) and the paper does not report inter-annotator agreement or confidence intervals (Section 4; Appendix A notes resource constraints).

- **Data management limitation**
  - The authors did not save the augmented windows (only the originals), though they claim augmentations can be regenerated from scripts (Appendix A). This can hinder exact reproducibility of the 100k training set.

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the landscape**
  - The work points toward treating time series as a “native” modality for LMM-style alignment by providing a concrete recipe: *use statistical tooling to produce structured signals, then use LLMs to generate aligned language supervision at scale* (Abstract; Section 2.1; Section 5).
  - It also shows that meaningful gains can come from **lightweight adaptation** (projection-only tuning) rather than expensive end-to-end training (Section 3; Figure 2).

- **Follow-up research enabled/suggested by the paper**
  - **Extend beyond trend**: generate descriptions for volatility changes and outlier detection using residuals, and add seasonality-focused labels (Section 5).
  - **Multi-feature time series**: generate language about cross-correlations and interactions across variables (Section 5).
  - **Native time-series encoders**: the authors tried swapping in a time-series encoder (`OneFitsAll`) but found it failed to generate coherent descriptions, likely due to lack of pretraining; pretraining a time-series encoder is flagged as future work (Section 5).

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases (grounded in the paper’s scope)**
  - Automating first-pass narrative summaries of time-series behavior (trend descriptions) in domains like energy, weather, traffic, healthcare, and economics—domains reflected in the dataset sources (Section 2.2; Appendix A).

- **Repro/Integration Guidance**
  - If you want a low-cost path to time-series insight generation, this paper suggests:
    - Use a pretrained multimodal backbone (here `LLaVA`), convert time series to a consistent plot format, and fine-tune only the projection layer on aligned time-series–text pairs (Section 3).
  - If you can afford tool-use preprocessing at inference time, the `Engineering GPT` baseline indicates GPT-4 plus extracted features can work reasonably well, but it is effectively zero-shot and may generalize worse than a tuned model on some holdout distributions (Section 4).
  - If you need multi-variable reasoning or numeric precision, this paper does not yet provide validated solutions; it explicitly treats those as future directions (Section 5).
