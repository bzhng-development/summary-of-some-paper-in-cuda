# Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation

**ArXiv:** [2512.13687](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687)

## 🎯 Pitch

The paper introduces VTP, a unified pre-training framework that jointly optimizes reconstruction with representation learning (image–text contrastive and self-supervised objectives) to produce latents that encode high-level semantics rather than only low-level pixels. This matters because it resolves the “pre-training scaling problem”: unlike reconstruction-only tokenizers that stagnate or degrade downstream generation as compute scales, VTP’s semantically structured latents scale with FLOPs, model size, and data to substantially improve and accelerate generative performance.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This paper addresses a mismatch in latent diffusion pipelines: visual tokenizers (autoencoders/VAEs) trained only for pixel reconstruction can keep improving reconstruction with more compute while *not* improving—and even hurting—downstream image generation. It introduces `VTP`, a unified visual-tokenizer pre-training framework that jointly optimizes reconstruction with representation learning (`CLIP`-style image–text contrastive learning + `DINOv2`-style self-supervision), producing a latent space that scales effectively for downstream generative quality as tokenizer compute/model/data scale up.

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem/gap addressed: the “pre-training scaling problem.”**
  - In latent diffusion models (`LDMs`), generation is performed in a compressed latent space produced by a *visual tokenizer* (e.g., a VAE/autoencoder) that is typically pre-trained separately using a reconstruction objective (Introduction).
  - A paradox appears: **better reconstruction does not guarantee better generation**, and a trade-off is widely observed (Introduction; Figure 1(c)).
  - The paper highlights a *scaling-specific* failure mode: **pouring more FLOPs into reconstruction-only tokenizer pre-training improves reconstruction metrics but does not translate into better downstream generation**, and can degrade it (Section 4.3; Figure 4).

- **Why it matters**
  - Modern generative pipelines (e.g., `DiT` diffusion transformers trained on tokenizer latents) depend heavily on the tokenizer’s latent space quality (Abstract; Introduction).
  - If tokenizer pre-training does not scale “in the right direction,” additional compute spent on tokenizers becomes inefficient for improving generation (Abstract; Introduction).

- **Prior approaches and their shortcomings (as positioned here)**
  - **Reconstruction-only tokenizers** bias latents toward low-level details and can move away from the “structured” latent space useful for generation as training scales (Introduction).
  - **Methods that inject semantics** exist in two broad patterns (Introduction; Related Work 2.2):
    - Explicitly enriching latents (e.g., adding specific semantic signals or leveraging powerful pre-trained features).
    - Regularizing/aligning latent features using representational priors or distillation from foundation models (e.g., `VA-VAE`, `REPA-E`).
  - The paper claims these are “preliminary” in the sense that **broader scaling properties (compute/model/data) are generally not verified** and some are limited by a ceiling imposed by fixed existing foundation representations (Related Work 2.2; Section 5).

- **How this paper positions itself**
  - It reframes tokenizer pre-training as **representation learning** rather than purely reconstruction (Figure 1; Figure 3).
  - It proposes a **joint, multi-objective pre-training** approach (reconstruction + self-supervised + image–text contrastive) and studies how this affects **scaling behavior for downstream generation** (Sections 3–4; Figures 5–7).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The system is a **Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder visual tokenizer** trained with multiple objectives so that its latent codes are useful for both reconstructing images and training latent-space diffusion models.
- It solves the problem of **tokenizer pre-training not scaling for generation** by shaping the latent space with **semantic representation learning losses** while still keeping reconstruction in the loop, and then using the resulting latents to train a standard `DiT` with unchanged training specs.

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Inputs:** image `I`, and (for contrastive learning) a paired caption/text `T`.
- **Core components:**
  1. **ViT encoder + bottleneck (“visual tokenizer”)**: maps `I` into a latent tensor `Z ∈ R^{d×H/16×W/16}` (Section 3.2).
  2. **Pixel decoder (ViT-based)**: reconstructs `I'` from `Z` for reconstruction losses (Section 3.2).
  3. **Text encoder**: encodes `T` into text features for image–text contrastive loss (Section 3.4; Figure 3).
  4. **EMA teacher**: an exponential-moving-average copy used for self-distillation / MIM targets (Section 3.3; Figure 3).
- **Training losses (combined):**
  - Reconstruction loss `L_rec` (L1 + perceptual).
  - Self-supervised loss `L_ssl` (masked image modeling + self-distillation).
  - Contrastive loss `L_clip` (CLIP-style image–text alignment).
- **Downstream:** freeze/use the trained tokenizer to encode ImageNet images into latents and train a fixed `LightningDiT-B` diffusion model for generation evaluation (Section 4.1; Figure 3).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- Explain (1) what the tokenizer outputs and why that matters for latent diffusion.
- Then cover (2) reconstruction training (including the two-stage stabilization strategy).
- Then cover (3) self-supervised learning signals (MIM + self-distillation via EMA teacher).
- Then cover (4) image–text contrastive learning and how it encourages semantic structure.
- Finally cover (5) how losses are combined + batch sampling, and (6) how downstream DiT evaluation is done under fixed specs.

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is an **empirical systems/algorithmic training-framework paper** whose core idea is that a visual tokenizer’s latent space becomes generation-scalable when it is trained not only to reconstruct pixels but also to learn semantically meaningful representations via contrastive and self-supervised objectives.

#### What the tokenizer is and what it outputs

- The visual tokenizer is an autoencoder whose **encoder is a Vision Transformer** and whose output latent representation is a **spatial latent tensor** `Z ∈ R^{d×H/16×W/16}` (Section 3.2).
  - Here, `H×W` is the input image resolution, `/16` reflects a downsampling ratio (also described as patch size for ViT in Section 4.2: the paper uses notation like `f16d64` where `f` is downsample ratio/patch size and `d` is bottleneck dimension).
  - `d` is the **bottleneck/latent channel dimension**, primarily `d=64` (Section 4.1), with an ablation at `d=256`.

- The downstream generative model (`DiT`) operates in this latent space: it learns to denoise noisy versions of `Z` (Figure 1(b); Figure 3).

#### Reconstruction training (and why it is two-stage)

- **Goal in plain language:** ensure the latents preserve enough visual detail so decoded samples look like valid images, while avoiding unstable training.
- The reconstruction pipeline is: encode image `I` → get latent `Z` → pixel decoder reconstructs image `I'` (Section 3.2).
  - The pixel decoder “lifts latents back to the feature space,” refines them with `N` ViT blocks, and outputs pixels via a final **pixel-shuffle** layer (Section 3.2).

- The paper reports a specific stability problem: **GAN loss is poorly compatible with ViT architectures** because it causes large gradient norms and instability (Section 3.2).
- To address this, it uses a **two-stage strategy** (Section 3.2):
  1. **Pre-training stage:** jointly train all parameters using a composite reconstruction loss consisting of `L1` plus a perceptual loss `L_perceptual` between `I` and `I'`.
     - The reconstruction loss is:
       - Plain-language paraphrase: “penalize pixel differences and also penalize differences in perceptual feature space.”
       - Notation: `L_rec = L1 + L_perceptual` (Section 3.2).
  2. **Second stage:** freeze the visual tokenizer and **fine-tune only the pixel decoder with a GAN objective** to improve fidelity (Section 3.2).
     - The paper does not provide the GAN objective’s exact formula in the provided excerpt.

#### Self-supervised learning (SSL): masked modeling + self-distillation

- **Goal in plain language:** force the tokenizer latents to capture more than low-level pixel detail, including spatial structure and semantics, by learning from augmentations and masked inputs without labels.
- The SSL framework follows `DINOv2` and has two parts (Section 3.3):
  1. **Masked image modeling (`MIM`)**
     - An image `I` is augmented into a **global view** `I_global` and a **local view** `I_local` (Section 3.3).
     - For MIM, `I_global` is patch-embedded and sent to the EMA teacher, while a masked version is processed by the visual tokenizer, producing a masking loss `L_mim` (Section 3.3; Figure 3).
     - Intuition: the tokenizer must infer missing patches, which encourages learning contextual/spatial representations rather than copying pixels.
  2. **Self-distillation (`DINO`)**
     - `I_global` and `I_local` are passed to the visual tokenizer, and `I_global` is also passed to the EMA teacher, with cross-entropy loss `L_dino` computed between student predictions and teacher pseudo-labels (Section 3.3; Figure 3).
     - Intuition: different crops/views should map to consistent semantic predictions, encouraging invariances and higher-level structure.

- The combined SSL loss is (Section 3.3, Eq. (1)):
  - Plain-language paraphrase: “sum the masked modeling loss and the self-distillation consistency loss.”
  - Notation: `L_ssl = L_mim + L_dino`.

#### Image–text contrastive learning (CLIP-style)

- **Goal in plain language:** explicitly align the visual latent features with text so the latent space organizes around *semantics* that matter for descriptions and categories.
- Given image–text pairs `(I, T)` (Section 3.4):
  - The visual tokenizer encodes `I` into visual features.
  - A text encoder encodes `T` into textual features.
  - A `CLIP`-style contrastive objective encourages matched image/text pairs to be similar and mismatched pairs to be dissimilar, producing `L_clip` (Section 3.4).

#### Joint multi-objective training: the VTP objective

- The paper’s central training mechanism is to **optimize reconstruction + self-supervision + contrastive alignment together**.
- The overall loss is (Section 3.5, Eq. (2)):
  - Plain-language paraphrase: “a weighted sum that keeps reconstruction active but allows semantic objectives to dominate as needed.”
  - Notation:
    - `L_total = λ_rec L_rec + λ_ssl L_ssl + λ_clip L_clip`,
    - with `λ_rec > 0`, `λ_ssl ≥ 0`, and `λ_clip ≥ 0` (Section 3.5).

- **Specific weights used in experiments (when stated):**
  - `λ_rec = 0.1`, and `λ_clip` and `λ_ssl` are set to either `0` or `1` depending on the configuration being tested (Section 4.1).
  - The paper notes that **smaller reconstruction weight improves generative performance** (Section 4.1).

#### Batch sampling strategy (to reconcile very different batch-size needs)

- Contrastive learning benefits from very large batch sizes, while SSL and reconstruction typically work with smaller ones (Section 3.6).
- Given an input batch of `B` image–caption pairs (Section 3.6):
  - Use all `B` for CLIP: `B_clip = B` (e.g., 16k).
  - Randomly sample subsets for SSL and reconstruction: `B_ssl` and `B_rec`.
- In implementation (Section 4.1), they set:
  - `B_clip = 16k`, `B_ssl = 4k`, `B_rec = 2k`.

#### Implementation details the paper provides (and what it does not)

- Provided (Section 4.1):
  - Uses a ViT implementation from [26].
  - Incorporates `QKNorm` to improve training stability.
  - Text encoder: **12-layer transformer**, hidden dimension **768**.
  - Pixel decoder for fast experiments: **4-layer ViT-Large**.
  - Bottleneck dimension: primarily `d=64`, with ablation at `d=256`.
  - Pre-training data: **internally filtered DataComp-1B** with **277M samples**.
  - Downstream generation training: ImageNet; trains `LightningDiT-B` for **80 epochs** under a fixed protocol.
  - Reconstruction evaluation: ImageNet validation set at **256** resolution; uses `rFID` as primary reconstruction metric.

- Not specified in the provided content:
  - Optimizer type and settings (e.g., AdamW params), learning rate schedule, weight decay, gradient clipping, training hardware, total training tokens/steps in the pretraining runs (beyond “FLOPs” plots), attention head counts, and tokenizer patch embedding details beyond the `f16` notation.

#### A concrete “one batch” walkthrough (micro-example)

For one training step on a batch of image–caption pairs:

1. **Start with `B` image–caption pairs** `(I, T)`.
2. **CLIP path (semantic alignment):**
   - Encode every `I` with the tokenizer encoder to get image features.
   - Encode every `T` with the text encoder to get text features.
   - Compute `L_clip` by pushing matched pairs together and unmatched pairs apart (Section 3.4).
3. **SSL path (semantic + spatial structure):**
   - Sample `B_ssl` pairs.
   - For each sampled image, create global/local crops; feed crops through student tokenizer and global crops through EMA teacher.
   - Compute `L_mim` from masked global-view reconstruction targets and `L_dino` from teacher–student pseudo-label consistency (Section 3.3).
4. **Reconstruction path (detail preservation):**
   - Sample `B_rec` images.
   - Encode to `Z`, decode to `I'`, compute `L1 + L_perceptual = L_rec` (Section 3.2).
5. **Combine losses** with `λ_rec, λ_ssl, λ_clip` into `L_total` and update model parameters (Section 3.5).

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

- **(1) Formulation of the “pre-training scaling problem” for visual tokenizers**
  - The paper crystallizes a specific failure mode: scaling reconstruction-only tokenizer pre-training can improve reconstruction while *degrading* downstream generation (Introduction; Figure 4).
  - This matters because it challenges an implicit assumption that “better tokenizer reconstruction” is a monotonic proxy for “better generator performance.”

- **(2) Joint multi-objective pre-training for tokenizers (CLIP + SSL + reconstruction)**
  - The core innovation is not using a single semantic auxiliary loss, but **a unified framework that jointly optimizes**:
    - cross-modal alignment (`L_clip`),
    - self-supervised representation learning (`L_ssl` = `L_mim + L_dino`),
    - and reconstruction (`L_rec`) (Section 3; Figure 3; Eq. (2)).
  - The paper claims (and provides evidence) that this combination is feasible/stable and produces better generative scaling (Section 4.3; Figure 6).

- **(3) Empirical claim: “understanding drives generation” in tokenizer latents**
  - The paper uses **linear probing accuracy on the bottleneck features** as a proxy for “understanding,” and shows a strong positive relationship between understanding metrics and generation metrics across scaling experiments (Introduction; Figure 2; Figure 5; Figure 6).

- **(4) Demonstration of tokenizer scalability along multiple axes**
  - Unlike reconstruction-only autoencoders that saturate early for downstream generation, `VTP` shows improved generation as you scale:
    - tokenizer training compute (FLOPs) (Figures 5–6),
    - tokenizer model size (encoder and decoder scaling) (Figure 7(b,c)),
    - tokenizer data size (Figure 7(a)).

## 5. Experimental Analysis

### Evaluation methodology (datasets, metrics, setup)

- **Tokenizer pre-training data:** internally filtered `DataComp-1B` subset with **277M samples** (Section 4.1).
- **Downstream generation data:** `ImageNet` (Section 4.1).
- **Downstream generator:** `LightningDiT-B` trained for **80 epochs** under a fixed configuration (Section 4.1).
- **Metrics:**
  - **Reconstruction:** `rFID` (reconstruction FID) reported on ImageNet validation at **256×256** (Section 4.1; Figure 4; Table 2). Table 1 also reports `rPSNR`.
  - **Understanding:** ImageNet **linear probing Top-1 accuracy** using only bottleneck features (no multi-layer feature enhancements) (Section 4.1). Table 2 also reports **zero-shot accuracy** for some models.
  - **Generation:** FID measured from the diffusion model trained on tokenizer latents.
    - Section 4.1 mentions reporting **FID-10k** for most cases in the scaling studies.
    - Table 2 reports **FID-50k**, with `LightningDiT` on ImageNet for 80 epochs, evaluated **without CFG** (classifier-free guidance).

### Main quantitative results (with anchored references)

**A. ViT tokenizers are competitive as autoencoders (Table 1).**
- Under the reported setup:
  - `ViT-L` autoencoder: `rPSNR = 31.28`, `gFID = 53.51`.
  - CNN tokenizer baseline (“CNN [25]”): `rPSNR = 30.63`, `gFID = 59.53`.
  - `ViT-L` uses more parameters (`607.2M`) but lower FLOPs than the CNN entry in Table 1 (Table 1).
- Interpretation within the paper: ViT is an effective and efficient substitute architecture for tokenizers (Section 4.2).

**B. Scaling reconstruction-only pre-training improves reconstruction but hurts generation (Figure 4).**
- As tokenizer training FLOPs increase:
  - `rFID` improves from **2.070 → 0.510** (better reconstruction).
  - `gFID` worsens from **55.04 → 58.56** (worse generation).
- This is the empirical signature of the “scaling paradox” the paper emphasizes (Section 4.3; Figure 4).

**C. Adding semantic objectives (CLIP or SSL) makes generation scale with compute and correlates with “understanding” (Figure 5).**
- The paper compares:
  - `AE only` vs `CLIP+AE` vs `SSL+AE`,
  - at latent dimensions `d=64` and `d=256`,
  - across compute scales (Figure 5).
- Qualitative takeaway anchored to the plotted relationships:
  - `AE only` sits in a regime where reconstruction improves but understanding/generation stagnate or degrade.
  - `CLIP+AE` and `SSL+AE` show **concurrent improvement** in understanding + generation as compute increases (Figure 5(a,d)).

**D. Combining both CLIP and SSL with reconstruction performs best under a fixed compute budget (Figure 6).**
- In the `f16d64` setting, the joint objective `CLIP+SSL+AE` achieves:
  - **Generation:** `gFID = 27.8`,
  - **Understanding:** `74.9%` linear probing accuracy (Figure 6).
- Figure 6 positions this as a stronger upper bound than “best CLIP+AE” or “best SSL+AE” under the same compute budget.

**E. Scaling behavior across data and parameters (Figure 7).**
- **Data scaling (Figure 7(a)):**
  - For `AE-B`, `gFID` barely changes with more data: **58.37 → 56.71** from 100K → 100M pretraining data size.
  - For `VTP-B`, `gFID` improves dramatically: **47.59 → 27.45** across the same data scaling (Figure 7(a)).
  - The paper emphasizes that downstream DiT training FLOPs are kept identical, isolating tokenizer pretraining as the driver (Section 4.5).
- **Encoder scaling (Figure 7(b)):**
  - `AE` variants remain around ~57 `gFID` across sizes (Figure 7(b)).
  - `VTP` improves as encoder size increases, with `gFID` improving from **31.28 → 26.12** (Figure 7(b); Section 4.4).
- **Decoder scaling (Figure 7(c)):**
  - Scaling decoder depth from 4 to 24 layers improves `VTP` `gFID` from **26.12 → 24.08**.
  - The analogous `AE` curves do not improve and slightly worsen (Figure 7(c)).

**F. Final comparison profile (Table 2 + Figures 8–9).**
- `VTP-L-d64` reports (Table 2):
  - **Understanding:** `78.2` zero-shot accuracy, `85.7` linear probe.
  - **Reconstruction:** `rFID = 0.36`.
  - **Generation:** `FID-50k = 2.81` (80 epochs, without CFG).
- The paper also claims a **4.1× faster convergence** on generation compared to prior distillation-based methods (`VA-VAE`), illustrated by convergence curves (Figure 9) and discussed in Section 5.
- Reconstruction visual comparison indicates `VTP` reduces color/texture artifacts compared to a fixed-representation approach (`RAE`) (Figure 8; Section 5).

### Do experiments support the claims?

- **Support for “reconstruction-only scaling fails for generation”:** directly shown by opposite trends in Figure 4 with explicit numbers.
- **Support for “understanding drives generation”:**
  - The paper operationalizes “understanding” as linear probe accuracy on bottleneck features and shows strong correlation plots (Figure 2; Figure 5(a,d); Figure 6(a)).
  - This is correlational evidence, not necessarily causal isolation, but the systematic comparisons (AE-only vs +CLIP vs +SSL vs +both) strengthen the argument that semantic objectives are a key factor.
- **Support for “scaling laws”:**
  - The paper provides separate scaling axes (compute, data, model size) and contrasts against reconstruction-only baselines (Figures 5–7).
  - The strongest evidence is that AE curves saturate while VTP curves improve consistently under controlled downstream training (Figure 7).

### Ablations / robustness checks mentioned

- **Latent dimension ablation:** `d=64` vs `d=256` (Section 4.1; Figure 5).
- **Objective ablations:** `AE only` vs `CLIP+AE` vs `SSL+AE` vs `CLIP+SSL+AE` (Figures 5–6).
- **Parameter scaling:** encoder size and decoder depth scaling (Figure 7(b,c)).
- **Data scaling:** 100K to 100M subsets, with equal “1.1 billion samples each” training budget (Section 4.5; Figure 7(a)).

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Missing training details for full reproducibility (in the provided content)**
  - The paper does not specify key optimizer/hyperparameter details (optimizer type, learning rate schedule, weight decay, training steps, hardware), which are important for faithfully reproducing large-scale pretraining behavior.

- **Dependence on paired image–text data**
  - `VTP`’s best configuration uses `CLIP`-style image–text contrastive learning, which requires image–caption pairs (Section 3.4; Figure 3; Section 4.1’s DataComp usage).
  - The framework includes SSL-only variants (`SSL+AE`), but the top reported joint setup uses both.

- **Two-stage training complexity**
  - Reconstruction uses a two-stage approach where the pixel decoder is later GAN-finetuned while freezing the tokenizer (Section 3.2).
  - This adds training complexity and introduces an additional “hand-off” point; the paper does not quantify how sensitive results are to the second-stage GAN procedure in the provided text.

- **Evaluation scope**
  - Downstream generation evaluation is centered on `ImageNet` with a fixed `LightningDiT-B` protocol (Section 4.1).
  - The provided content does not show how well scaling conclusions transfer to other datasets, resolutions, or other generator architectures beyond the stated DiT setup.

- **“Understanding” proxy is narrow**
  - Understanding is measured via ImageNet linear probing on bottleneck features (Section 4.1), which is a useful but specific proxy.
  - The paper does not, in the provided excerpt, test other semantic evaluations (e.g., retrieval, dense prediction) to triangulate what semantic aspects matter most.

- **Data filtering is internal**
  - The tokenizer pretraining data is an “internally filtered” DataComp-1B subset (Section 4.1), but filtering criteria and contamination checks are not described here.

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the landscape (within the paper’s framing)**
  - The work suggests that **tokenizer pre-training should be treated as scalable representation learning**, not just reconstruction, if the goal is to improve latent diffusion generation at scale (Abstract; Introduction; Figure 1).
  - It provides empirical evidence that **tokenizer scaling can be made productive**: generation improves with tokenizer compute/model/data when semantic objectives are included (Figures 5–7), in contrast to reconstruction-only saturation.

- **Follow-up research directions explicitly suggested**
  - **Broader multi-objective pretraining:** the paper asks what other perceptual/representation tasks could be integrated into multi-objective tokenizer pretraining beyond CLIP and SSL (Conclusion).
  - **Data distribution as a lever:** it suggests not only scaling data size but also tailoring data distributions (e.g., text-rendering-heavy data) to unlock specialized downstream generative capabilities (Conclusion).

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases**
  - Any setting using a two-stage latent generative pipeline (tokenizer → latent diffusion/DiT) could benefit if improved generation can be achieved by scaling tokenizer pretraining alone while keeping downstream generator training fixed (Figure 1; Sections 4–5).

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (based on the provided paper)**
  - Prefer `VTP`-style multi-objective tokenizer pretraining when:
    - you are training latent diffusion/DiT models and observe that improving tokenizer reconstruction does not improve generation (the failure mode in Figure 4),
    - you want improvements *without changing downstream DiT training specs* (a core experimental control emphasized in Figure 1 and Section 4).
  - Minimal integration steps implied by the pipeline (Figure 3):
    1. Pretrain a ViT-based tokenizer with `L_total = λ_rec L_rec + λ_ssl L_ssl + λ_clip L_clip`, using large batches for CLIP (`B_clip=16k`) and smaller sampled batches for SSL/reconstruction (Section 3.6; Section 4.1).
    2. Use the pretrained tokenizer to encode images into latents `Z` and train a standard DiT in latent space under an unchanged training recipe (Section 4.1; Figure 3).
