# REVISITING MULTIMODAL POSITIONAL ENCODING IN
VISION–LANGUAGE MODELS

**ArXiv:** [2510.23095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23095)

## 🎯 Pitch

This paper gives the first systematic analysis of how rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) should be extended from text-only LLMs to mixed 1D/2D/3D vision–language inputs, decomposing multimodal RoPE into position design and frequency allocation and deriving three practical design guidelines. Guided by these insights it proposes two plug-and-play solutions (Multi-Head RoPE and MRoPE-Interleave) plus a spatial-reset tweak that preserve text RoPE compatibility and full frequency use, yielding consistent, measurable gains across image, video, and grounding benchmarks—improving spatial reasoning and long-range multimodal modeling in VLMs.

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This paper systematically analyzes how `Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)` should be extended from text-only `Large Language Models (LLMs)` to `Vision–Language Models (VLMs)` that mix 1D text with 2D/3D visual tokens. It decomposes “multimodal RoPE” into (i) `position design` (how to assign coordinates/IDs to text and visual tokens) and (ii) `frequency allocation` (how RoPE frequencies are assigned across axes), distilling three guidelines—`positional coherence`, `full frequency utilization`, and `preservation of textual priors`. Guided by these, it proposes two plug-and-play variants, `Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE)` and `MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I)`, plus a `spatial-reset` tweak, and shows consistent improvements across image, video, and grounding benchmarks (Tables 2–4).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **What specific problem/gap is addressed?**
  - VLMs need positional encoding that can represent:
    - 1D order for text, and
    - 2D (image) / 3D (video: time-height-width) geometry for visual tokens.
  - Despite multimodal RoPE being widely used, the paper argues there has been **little systematic investigation** into *which design choices matter* and *why* (Abstract, Section 1).

- **Why is this important?**
  - Self-attention is **permutation-invariant**, so without positional encoding, token order/structure is ambiguous (Section 1).
  - Flattening visual tokens into 1D can harm tasks requiring spatial grounding and geometry-aware reasoning (Section 1; Figure 1a discussion; Table 2 ChartQA / RefCOCO patterns).

- **What prior approaches existed, and where do they fall short?**
  - **1D sequential designs** (`vanilla RoPE`, `V2PE`):
    - Flatten everything into one sequence, losing native visual structure (Section 2.2.1; Figure 1a).
    - Can create very large position IDs for long sequences, hurting extrapolation (Section 2.2.1).
    - `V2PE` mitigates growth by scaling visual position steps (Section 2.2.1), but still ignores 3D structure.
  - **Multi-dimensional designs** (`MRoPE`, `VideoRoPE/HoPE`, `CircleRoPE`, `IL-RoPE/Omni-RoPE`):
    - Preserve some 3D structure, but introduce issues in either:
      - positional ambiguity / overlap causing “modalities confusion in generation” (VideoRoPE/HoPE diagonal layout; Section 2.2.2 and Table 3),
      - poor modality interval (CircleRoPE; Section 2.2.2),
      - frequency spectrum “chunking” that harms long-range temporal reasoning and/or multi-scale spatial reasoning (Section 2.3.2; Figures 3–4),
      - breaking compatibility with the base LLM’s text RoPE (IL-RoPE/Omni-RoPE; Section 2.4; Figure 1e).

- **How does this paper position itself?**
  - It aims for a **holistic** positional encoding strategy that supports **unified image + video understanding** and **fine-grained grounding**, rather than specialized schemes optimized for only one domain (Section 1).
  - It explicitly evaluates and compares methods along three axes: `position design`, `frequency allocation`, and `compatibility with text-only RoPE` (Table 1; Section 2).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The system is a **multimodal positional encoding scheme** (RoPE variants) that can be dropped into a transformer-based VLM without changing the model architecture.
- It solves the problem of giving the model **unambiguous, geometry-aware positions** for mixed text/image/video tokens while maintaining good **long-context behavior** and **transfer from a pretrained text LLM** (Sections 1–2).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Inputs:** interleaved sequences of text segments and visual token blocks (images and/or video frames) (Figure 1 caption).
- **Position design module:** assigns each token a position identifier:
  - text: 1D positions (like the base LLM),
  - visual: 3D tuple `(t, h, w)` with `spatial-reset` (Sections 2.2–2.5).
- **Frequency allocation module:** decides how RoPE’s frequency spectrum is distributed across `(t, h, w)` (Section 2.3; Figures 3–4).
- **RoPE application:** rotates query/key vectors using those positions so attention depends on relative positions (Section 2.1; Eq. (1)).
- **Output:** attention scores and downstream VLM behavior that better supports spatial reasoning, grounding, and long video (Tables 2–7).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- Explain `vanilla RoPE` and why it works for text (Eq. (1), frequency spectrum).
- Define the two design levers for multimodal RoPE:
  1. `position design` (how positions/coordinates are assigned),
  2. `frequency allocation` (how frequency channels/heads map to axes).
- Show failure modes in existing multimodal extensions (Figures 1–2; Section 2.2–2.4).
- Describe the proposed fixes:
  - `spatial-reset`,
  - `MHRoPE` (multi-head allocation),
  - `MRoPE-I` (interleaved allocation) (Sections 2.3.3–2.5).
- Connect these choices to empirical outcomes (Tables 2–4, plus appendices Tables 5–7 and Figure 5).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

- **Framing:** This is an **empirical + algorithmic design** paper that introduces two RoPE variants and a position-assignment tweak, motivated by an analytical decomposition of multimodal RoPE into `position design` and `frequency allocation` (Abstract; Sections 2–3).

#### 3.4.1 Vanilla RoPE recap (what it computes and why relative position emerges)

- RoPE encodes position by **rotating** query and key vectors rather than adding embeddings (Section 2.1).
- Given a query `q` at position `m` and a key `k` at position `n`, attention uses:
  - `S = (R_m q)^T (R_n k) = q^T R_{n-m} k` (Eq. (1)).
- The key property is that the score depends on **relative position** `n − m`, because `R_m^T R_n = R_{n-m}` (Eq. (1)).
- Frequencies are fixed as a geometric progression:
  - `θ_i = base^{-2i/d}` for `i ∈ [0, d/2 − 1]` (Section 2.1),
  - creating a spectrum from **high frequency** (small `i`) to **low frequency** (large `i`).

#### 3.4.2 Multimodal RoPE: two design degrees of freedom

The paper treats multimodal RoPE as two coupled choices (Section 2):

1. **`Position design`:** What is a token’s “position” when you have text + image/video tokens?
2. **`Frequency allocation`:** Once position is multi-axis (e.g., `(t,h,w)`), which RoPE frequencies encode which axis?

A third constraint is emphasized:

3. **`Compatibility with text-only RoPE`:** Keep text encoding identical to the pretrained LLM’s RoPE so transfer learning works well (Section 2.4).

#### 3.4.3 Position design: what can go wrong and what “positional coherence” means

- **1D sequential design (vanilla RoPE / V2PE):**
  - All tokens share a single increasing position ID; visual tokens are flattened so they lose 2D/3D structure (Section 2.2.1; Figure 1a).
  - Very long multimodal sequences can create very large position indices, which can hurt extrapolation (Section 2.2.1; Appendix D.4 notes sharp drop for vanilla RoPE at long contexts).
  - `V2PE` reduces growth by setting a modality-specific step size for visuals (`s_visual ∈ {1, 1/2, …, 1/256}`), but still does not encode 3D geometry (Section 2.2.1).

- **Multi-dimensional design (MRoPE):**
  - Visual tokens get a 3D coordinate like `(t, h, w)`; text and modalities are laid out to avoid overlaps by “jumping” temporal position past the previous block:
    - `m_next^t = max(m_prev^t, m_prev^h, m_prev^w) + 1` (Eq. (2); Section 2.2.2).
  - This preserves 3D structure and avoids overlaps, but the paper observes a **visual “attention sink”**: attention concentrates near the top-left corner `(t,0,0)` of each visual block (Section 2.2.3; Figure 2).

- **Diagonal layout (VideoRoPE / HoPE style):**
  - Shifts frames along spatial axes too (Figure 1c), intended for “inter-modal symmetry” (Section 2.2.2).
  - The paper identifies a critical flaw: for high-resolution visuals (e.g., documents), spatial coordinates can extend into the range used by generated text tokens, creating **position overlap** and “modalities confusion in generation” (Section 2.2.2).
  - In ablations, this manifests as repetitive nonsensical output like `"1111..."` even if applied only at inference (Section 3.3.1; Table 3).

- **Circle layout (CircleRoPE):**
  - Places image tokens on a “ring” orthogonal to text (Figure 1d; Section 2.2.2).
  - The paper argues it can introduce:
    - a large modality interval that may hinder cross-modal interaction,
    - temporal ambiguity for video because it collapses frames onto one ring (Section 2.2.2).

- **Positional coherence (paper’s guideline):**
  - A robust position design should (Section 2.2.3):
    1. preserve 3D visual structure,
    2. keep slow growth of position IDs,
    3. avoid text/visual confusion during generation,
    4. define an appropriate `modality interval` (gap/layout between modalities).

#### 3.4.4 Spatial-reset: the paper’s position-design fix

- **Definition (paper-specific):** `spatial-reset` resets the spatial coordinates `(h,w)` for each separate visual content block, instead of letting them be offset by time or by prior blocks (Section 2.2.3; Figure 1f discussion).
- It is motivated by two mechanisms described in the paper:
  1. **Aligning attention sinks:** Since LLMs often attend more to small position IDs, resetting spatial positions makes the visual block’s salient “small IDs” align with that bias, improving visual adaptation (Section 2.2.3; Figure 2).
  2. **Disentangling motion (video):** Without spatial-reset, time and space get coupled in the absolute position definition, which entangles relative indices (Section 2.2.3).
     - The paper illustrates the entanglement:
       - Standard MRoPE positions:
         - `m1 = (t1, t1+h1, t1+w1)`, `m2 = (t2, t2+h2, t2+w2)`,
         - so relative position becomes (Eq. (3)):
           - `m_rel = (t2−t1, (t2−t1)+(h2−h1), (t2−t1)+(w2−w1))`.
     - With spatial-reset, positions become:
       - `m1 = (t1, h1, w1)`, `m2 = (t2, h2, w2)`,
       - yielding a clean spatio-temporal delta (Eq. (4)):
         - `m_rel = (t2−t1, h2−h1, w2−w1)`.
- **Micro-example (single walk-through using the paper’s equations):**
  - Suppose an object moves right by 2 pixels between frames: at time `t1=5` it is at `(h1=10,w1=10)`, and at time `t2=6` it is at `(h2=10,w2=12)`.
  - Under Eq. (3) entanglement, the horizontal relative component becomes `(t2−t1)+(w2−w1) = 1+2 = 3`, mixing time and space.
  - Under spatial-reset (Eq. (4)), the horizontal delta is `w2−w1 = 2`, cleanly representing “moved right by 2” independent of time-step size.

#### 3.4.5 Frequency allocation: why “chunking” harms and what “full frequency utilization” means

- **What frequency allocation controls:** how feature dimensions (and their associated `θ_i`) are assigned to axes `t`, `h`, `w` (Section 2.3).
- **Problem with standard MRoPE “chunked” allocation:**
  - It splits the `d` channels into three contiguous blocks for `t/h/w` (Section 2.3.2; Figure 3).
  - Because frequencies decay with channel index, the paper argues this forces:
    - the temporal axis `t` into **high-frequency channels only** → faster long-range decay over time,
    - spatial axes into different frequency ranges → asymmetric decay between `h` and `w` (Section 2.3.2; Figure 4a).
- The paper links frequency allocation to an attention-decay analysis:
  - It describes an upper bound whose position-dependent term can be approximated by a sum like `∑ |S_{i+1}|` (Section 2.3.1; Appendix D.2 provides derivation and Eq. (6)).
  - The practical takeaway used in the paper is that frequency allocation affects how quickly attention decays with distance along each axis (Figures 4a–4b).

- **Guideline: full frequency utilization**
  - Each positional axis should have access to the **full frequency spectrum** (high → low) to support:
    - fine-grained spatial relationships (needs high-frequency components),
    - long-range temporal dependencies (needs low-frequency components),
    - symmetric multi-scale modeling across axes (Section 2.3.2–2.3.3).

#### 3.4.6 The proposed methods: MHRoPE and MRoPE-I

Both methods share:
- **Position design:** MRoPE-style 3D structure **plus** `spatial-reset` (Section 2.5; Figure 1f).
- **Text compatibility:** keep text tokens’ RoPE identical to the base LLM (Section 2.4–2.5).

They differ in frequency allocation:

1. **`Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE)` = multi-head allocation**
   - Instead of splitting channels within a head, it dedicates different **attention heads** to different axes (Section 2.3.3; Figure 3).
   - Claimed advantages in the paper:
     - each axis uses the full within-head frequency spectrum (avoids per-axis “coarsening” from channel splitting),
     - may scale better as the number of axes grows (Section 2.3.3).
   - Implementation note given:
     - For `Group Query Attention (GQA)`, the partition is on KV heads and repeated for corresponding query heads (footnote in Section 2.4).

2. **`MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I)` = interleaved allocation**
   - Distributes channels to axes in a fine-grained round-robin manner (Section 2.3.3; Figure 3).
   - Ensures each axis sees high-to-low frequencies, improving multi-scale modeling (Section 2.3.3).
   - The paper notes compatibility with extrapolation schemes that rescale frequency spectra (Appendix D.3), precisely because each axis has a full spectrum (Figure 4b discussion).

#### 3.4.7 System/data pipeline “diagram in words” (what happens first → second → third)

Within the VLM forward pass implied by Sections 2–3:

1. **First, tokenize/encode inputs** into a single interleaved sequence containing text tokens and visual tokens (images as 2D grids; videos as stacked frames), as illustrated by the example sequence in Figure 1’s caption.
2. **Second, assign positions:**
   - text tokens get standard 1D increasing positions (kept compatible with the base LLM; Section 2.4),
   - visual tokens get 3D positions `(t,h,w)` with `spatial-reset` so each visual block starts with small spatial coordinates (Section 2.2.3; Eq. (4) motivation).
3. **Third, map axes to RoPE frequencies:**
   - `MHRoPE`: choose per-head axis responsibility so each axis is encoded with full-spectrum RoPE inside its heads (Section 2.3.3),
   - `MRoPE-I`: interleave channels so each axis receives high-to-low frequencies across the embedding (Section 2.3.3).
4. **Fourth, apply RoPE rotations** to queries/keys using the positions, so attention depends on relative offsets (Section 2.1; Eq. (1)).
5. **Finally, compute attention and decode outputs**, where improved positional encoding should yield better spatial grounding, better long-range video modeling, and fewer generation pathologies (Tables 2–4; Section 3.3.1).

#### 3.4.8 Core configurations / hyperparameters (as provided)

From Section 3.1 (and appendices where relevant):

- **Backbone / components:**
  - Vision encoder: `QwenViT` (from Qwen2.5VL) (Section 3.1).
  - Connector: from Qwen2.5VL (Section 3.1).
  - LLM backbone initialization: `Qwen2.5 7B` (Section 3.1).

- **Trainable vs frozen:**
  - Freeze `ViT` (visual encoder).
  - Unfreeze `connector` and `LLM backbone` (Section 3.1).
  - The paper states this is to isolate RoPE effects while following typical adaptation patterns (Section 3.1).

- **Optimization/training settings (reported):**
  - Batch size: `128` (Section 3.1).
  - Learning rate: `1 × 10^-5` with cosine decay (Section 3.1).
  - Training compute per experiment: ~`512 Nvidia A100 GPU hours` (Section 3.1).
  - Training context length: `32K` tokens (Section 3.1).
  - Rotary base: `1,000,000` (Section 3.1).

- **Not specified in the provided content (cannot be filled without guessing):**
  - Optimizer type (e.g., AdamW) and its parameters (betas, weight decay, eps).
  - Number of training steps/epochs.
  - Tokenizer details.
  - Exact transformer hyperparameters: number of layers, hidden size, attention heads, MLP size.
  - Visual tokenization specifics (patch size, tokens per image/frame) and any image/video resolution policies.

  - Supervised fine-tuning samples: ~`2M` high-quality SFT samples (Section 3.1).
  - Data task coverage includes captioning, OCR, reasoning, grounding, document understanding, long video understanding (Section 3.1).

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

- **(1) A clean decomposition of multimodal RoPE into position design + frequency allocation + text compatibility**
  - Novelty is not a brand-new architecture, but a systematic lens and evaluation grid (Table 1; Section 2).
  - Significance: it explains why the field has “fragmented” into specialized solutions—because these axes trade off against each other (Section 1; Sections 2.2–2.4).

- **(2) `Spatial-reset` as a simple position-design tweak with broad impact**
  - It addresses an observed “visual attention sink” (Figure 2) and produces measurable gains in ablations:
    - Adding `3D + spatial-reset` improves Image/Video/Grounding over vanilla and over “3D only” (Table 3).
  - It also yields a conceptual improvement for video: disentangling temporal vs spatial relative offsets (Eq. (3) → Eq. (4)).

- **(3) `Full frequency utilization` as a guiding principle, and two plug-and-play mechanisms to achieve it**
  - The paper argues chunked allocation restricts axes to partial frequency bands, harming long-range temporal and multi-scale spatial modeling (Section 2.3.2; Figures 3–4a).
  - It proposes two ways to give each axis a full spectrum:
    - `MHRoPE`: allocate by heads (Section 2.3.3),
    - `MRoPE-I`: interleave channels (Section 2.3.3).
  - Ablations show both outperform “partial spectrum” schemes (Table 4).

- **(4) Preservation of text RoPE as essential for transfer**
  - The paper tests deviations (e.g., resetting text spatial dimensions; scaling rotary base for spatial axes) and finds they degrade performance (Section 3.3.1; Table 3; Section 2.4).
  - This is a practical insight: multimodal improvements should not come at the cost of breaking pretrained LLM positional priors.

## 5. Experimental Analysis

### 5.1 Evaluation methodology (datasets, metrics, baselines, setup)

- **Training setup:**
  - Same architecture, same training data (~2M SFT), same hyperparameters across comparisons; only RoPE variant changes (Section 3.1).
  - ViT frozen; connector + LLM unfrozen (Section 3.1).
  - Context length 32K; rotary base 1e6 (Section 3.1).

- **Benchmarks (20+ total) grouped as:**

- **Metrics:**
  - The paper reports benchmark scores as percentages/points per dataset in Table 2; it does not further specify metric definitions in the provided content (so I treat them as the benchmark’s standard scalar score).

### 5.2 Main quantitative results (with specific numbers)

From **Table 2** (selected highlights, all numbers are as reported):

- **Image benchmarks:**
  - `MMMU`: vanilla `50.56` → `MRoPE-I 53.22` (**+2.67**) and `MHRoPE 53.00`.
  - `ChartQA`: vanilla `56.84` → `MRoPE-I 62.12` (**+5.28**) and `MHRoPE 62.44`.
  - `DocVQA`: vanilla `82.94` → `MRoPE-I 83.72` (+0.78).
  - Some datasets show small or negative deltas for `MRoPE-I` vs vanilla (e.g., AI2D `-0.84`, RealWorldQA `-0.92`, InfoVQA `-0.62`), indicating gains are not universal across every benchmark.

- **Video benchmarks:**
  - `LVBench`: vanilla `38.93` → `MRoPE-I 40.54` (**+1.61**).
  - `Charades-STA`: vanilla `32.49` → `MRoPE-I 34.36` (**+1.87**).
  - `VideoMME`: vanilla `58.63` → `MRoPE-I 58.96` (+0.33).
  - `MVBench`: vanilla `57.05` → `MRoPE-I 57.05` (+0.00).

- **Grounding (RefCOCO family):**
  - `RefCOCOval`: vanilla `77.67` → `MRoPE-I 80.94` (**+3.27**).
  - `RefCOCOtestA`: vanilla `81.37` → `MRoPE-I 84.55` (**+3.18**).
  - `RefCOCOtestB`: vanilla `72.66` → `MRoPE-I 75.05` (**+2.39**).
  - Similar gains appear across RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg splits (Table 2).

- **Aggregated category averages (Table 2 “Overall” rows):**
  - Image avg: vanilla `65.69` → `MRoPE-I 66.65` (+0.96).
  - Video avg: vanilla `51.64` → `MRoPE-I 52.36` (+0.72).
  - Grounding avg: vanilla `73.48` → `MRoPE-I 75.85` (+2.36).

### 5.3 Do experiments support the claims?

- **Support for “spatial-reset helps”:** Strongly supported by Table 3 and Appendix Table 5.
  - Table 3 shows a monotonic improvement from:
    - vanilla → `+3D structure` → `+3D + spatial-reset` across Image/Grounding/Video and key doc/chart tasks.
  - Appendix Table 5 shows higher average attention mass on visual tokens with spatial-reset in deeper layers (e.g., for `MRoPE-I`, Layer 28: `23.23` vs `11.69` without spatial-reset).

- **Support for “full frequency utilization helps”:** Supported by Table 4.
  - With position design fixed (MRoPE + spatial-reset), frequency allocations compare as:
    - VideoRoPE-like Overall `63.31`,
    - IL-RoPE-like Overall `63.07`,
    - `Multi-Head` Overall `64.63`,
    - `Interleave` Overall `64.95` (best) (Table 4).

- **Support for “diagonal layout causes generation confusion”:** Supported by Table 3 plus qualitative description.
  - `+ diagonal layout` causes large drops in DocVQA (`60.13`), InfoVQA (`37.42`), ChartQA (`54.88`) relative to vanilla (Table 3).
  - The paper reports repetitive output failure (“1111…”) and attributes it to positional overlap (Section 3.3.1).

### 5.4 Ablations, robustness checks, and long-context behavior

- **Position design ablation (Table 3):**
  - Shows the impact of:
    - adding 3D structure,
    - adding spatial-reset,
    - diagonal layout,
    - enlarged modality interval,
    - text spatial-reset (breaking text compatibility),
    - scaling rotary base for spatial axes (breaking compatibility).
  - Notably, `text spatial-reset` drops Image to `58.27` and ChartQA to `44.33` (Table 3), aligning with the “preserve textual priors” guideline.

- **Frequency allocation ablation (Table 4):**
  - Interleave and Multi-Head outperform partial spectrum schemes.

- **Interleave ratio ablation (Appendix Table 6):**
  - Balanced ratio `t:h:w = 24:20:20` gives best overall `64.95`.
  - Increasing temporal share harms grounding (e.g., `48:8:8` grounding `72.87` vs `75.85`) (Table 6).

- **Temporal stride ablation (Appendix Table 7):**
  - Stride `δ = 1` yields best overall on video suite (`52.36`) vs `0.5` (`51.11`) or `2` (`51.10`); dynamic stride gives `51.80` (Table 7).

- **Extrapolation / long context (Appendix D.4, Figure 5):**
  - Models trained at 32K and extrapolated to 64K/128K/256K.
  - The paper reports vanilla RoPE sharply drops at 128K/256K and attributes it to fast-growing position IDs (Appendix D.4; Figure 5).
  - It also notes VideoRoPE/HoPE have slightly better extrapolation in long-video scenarios, but MHRoPE/MRoPE-I are “most comprehensive and balanced” when considering images + grounding too (Appendix D.4).

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Incomplete “win everywhere”:** Even the best method (`MRoPE-I`) has small regressions on some image benchmarks (e.g., AI2D and RealWorldQA in Table 2), suggesting the improvements are strongest on geometry/grounding-heavy tasks rather than uniformly boosting all capabilities.

- **MHRoPE vs MRoPE-I trade-off (Appendix D.1):**
  - The paper recommends `MRoPE-I` due to:
    - slight performance advantage,
    - simpler implementation.
  - It hypothesizes `MHRoPE` can underperform because head-level partitioning “prevents the integration of different positional axes within the self-attention mechanism” (Appendix D.1).

- **Engineering constraints (Appendix D.1):**
  - `MHRoPE` is said to complicate distributed training such as tensor parallelism, whereas `MRoPE-I` is simpler.

- **Scope of experiments:**
  - Training is performed with Qwen2.5VL components and `Qwen2.5 7B` initialization, with the ViT frozen (Section 3.1).
  - The paper does not provide evidence (in the provided content) that results generalize across:
    - different VLM architectures,
    - different LLM backbones,
    - different visual tokenization schemes,
    - full end-to-end finetuning where the ViT is unfrozen.

- **Missing system-performance reporting:**
  - No latency/throughput/memory overhead numbers are provided for these RoPE variants in the excerpt, so practical serving cost differences are not quantified here.

- **Hyperparameter transparency gaps (from what’s provided):**
  - Optimizer type and key model configuration (layers/heads/hidden size/tokenizer) are not specified in the provided content, limiting exact reproducibility from this summary alone (even though the paper includes a reproducibility statement).

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the landscape (within the paper’s scope):**
  - It reframes multimodal positional encoding as a small set of design constraints rather than a growing set of bespoke methods per domain (images vs videos vs generation).
  - The three guidelines—`positional coherence`, `full frequency utilization`, `preservation of textual priors`—serve as a checklist for future multimodal RoPE designs (Abstract; Section 4).

- **Follow-up research suggested by the paper’s findings:**
  - **Scalability to more axes:** MHRoPE is motivated as more scalable when positional axes increase (Section 2.3.3).
  - **Better long-context extrapolation:** Appendix D.3 suggests `MRoPE-I` aligns well with frequency-rescaling extrapolation methods because each axis has a full spectrum, and Appendix D.4 highlights remaining extrapolation differences among methods.
  - **Understanding attention sinks:** The “visual attention sink” (Figure 2) and the effect of spatial-reset (Appendix Table 5) suggest further mechanistic study of how positional IDs interact with pretrained attention biases.

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases:**
  - If you need one positional encoding that performs well across:
    - general image understanding,
    - long video understanding,
    - fine-grained grounding (RefCOCO),
  - the paper’s results indicate `MRoPE-I` is the most consistently strong single choice (Tables 2 and 4; Appendix D.1 recommendation).

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (when to prefer what, based on this paper):**
  - Prefer `MRoPE-I` when you want:
    - the best overall balance and slightly better scores than MHRoPE (Tables 2, 4; Appendix D.1),
    - simpler implementation and fewer distributed-training complications (Appendix D.1),
    - compatibility with frequency-spectrum rescaling style extrapolation (Appendix D.3).
  - Consider `MHRoPE` when:
    - you anticipate needing to add more positional axes in the future and want head-based scalability (Section 2.3.3),
    - you can tolerate slightly lower performance and higher implementation complexity (Appendix D.1).
  - Avoid position designs that create overlap between visual coordinates and generated text positions:
    - the diagonal layout causes severe failures on document-style tasks and induces repetitive generation (Section 3.3.1; Table 3).
  - Keep text RoPE unchanged from the base LLM:
    - “text spatial-reset” and spatial rotary-base scaling degrade performance (Section 3.3.1; Table 3), supporting the “preservation of textual priors” guideline.
