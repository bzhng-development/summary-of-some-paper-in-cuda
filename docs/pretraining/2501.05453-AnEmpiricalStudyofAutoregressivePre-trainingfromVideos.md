# An Empirical Study of Autoregressive Pre-training from Videos

**ArXiv:** [2501.05453](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05453)

## 🎯 Pitch

This paper introduces Toto, a family of decoder-only autoregressive transformers that treat images and videos as sequences of visual tokens and are pre-trained on ~1 trillion visual tokens to predict next tokens. It shows that simple next-token prediction on large, mixed image/video data yields competitive, general-purpose visual representations across recognition, tracking, forecasting, and robotics, and demonstrates compute–loss scaling behavior for video models analogous to language models—supporting a scalable, unified approach to visual foundation models.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This paper studies whether a simple `next-token prediction` objective—applied to **videos tokenized into sequences of visual tokens**—can produce strong, general-purpose visual representations. It introduces a family of decoder-only autoregressive transformers called `Toto`, pre-trained on a mixture of images and internet videos totaling **~1T training tokens** (from a larger pool of **~2.5T tokens / ~100k hours**), and evaluates the learned representations across recognition, forecasting, tracking, object permanence, and robotics tasks. The main takeaway is that **autoregressive pre-training from videos works competitively with minimal inductive bias**, and exhibits **compute–loss scaling** similar in form (power law) to language models but with a slower exponent (Section 4.9, Figure 9).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **What specific problem or gap does this paper address?**
  - Large Language Models demonstrate that **autoregressive next-token prediction** can produce broadly useful representations, but the analogous question for **video**—the dominant “big visual data”—is “underexplored” (Introduction).
  - The paper targets the gap: *Can we learn strong, transferable visual/video representations by training a decoder-only model to predict the next visual token in sequences derived from images and videos?* (Introduction, Section 3).

- **Why is this problem important?**
  - Videos contain rich temporal dynamics and diverse real-world signals (egocentric, instructional, action-centric), and the paper argues that video data is still early in large-scale exploitation compared to internet text (Introduction).
  - A unified autoregressive objective that works across **images + videos** could simplify pre-training and produce representations reusable across many tasks (Figure 1, Sections 3.3–3.5).

- **What prior approaches existed, and where do they fall short (as positioned here)?**
  - **Discriminative self-supervised** methods (e.g., instance discrimination, contrastive, DINO-like) are strong for recognition but are not generative (Section 2; comparisons in Tables 7–8).
  - **Masked modeling** (e.g., MAE/VideoMAE) learns representations by reconstructing masked tokens with a lightweight decoder; it is not pure next-token generation (Section 2).
  - Earlier **autoregressive vision** work (PixelCNN/Image Transformer/iGPT) mostly focused on images or generation quality; iGPT showed representation learning from pixels, but this paper explores **videos at larger token scale** and different design choices (Section 2; Appendix A.4; Table 14).

- **How this paper positions itself relative to existing work**
  - It emphasizes: **no supervision during pre-training**, joint training on images+videos via a unified token format, and a broad multi-task evaluation beyond standard recognition (Introduction; Section 4).
  - It frames itself as an **empirical study**: exploring tokenizers, architectures, resolution strategies, probing choices, and scaling (Section 4.1; Section 4.9).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)
- The system is a **decoder-only transformer** trained like a language model, except its “words” are **visual tokens** produced from video frames or images.
- It solves representation learning by doing **autoregressive next-token prediction** over token sequences derived from **raster-scanned patches** from images and from sequences of video frames (Figure 1; Section 3.1).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)
- **(1) Data sources** (images + videos) →  
- **(2) Frame preprocessing** (resize/crop/sample frames) →  
- **(3) Tokenizer** (e.g., `dVAE`, optionally `VQGAN` or continuous patch tokens) converts each frame/image into a grid of tokens →  
- **(4) Sequence construction** (raster scan + temporal concatenation + special start/end tokens) →  
- **(5) Causal transformer (`Toto`)** predicts the next token at each position (Sections 3.1–3.4) →  
- **(6) Representation extraction** from intermediate layers + **attention pooling** or average pooling →  
- **(7) Downstream evaluation** via linear/attention probing or task-specific fine-tuning depending on the task (Section 3.5; Section 4).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive
- I will explain:
  1. **How images/videos become token sequences** (tokenization + ordering), because this defines the learning problem (Section 3.4).
  2. **The autoregressive objective** and what the model is optimizing (Section 3.1, Eq. (1)–(2)).
  3. **The transformer architecture and training setup** (Section 3.2, Table 1).
  4. **The data mixture and scale** (Section 3.3, Table 2).
  5. **How representations are extracted and probed** (Section 3.5; Tables 5–6; Figures 4, 8).
  6. **Key design-choice findings** (tokenizer/resolution/architecture) that affect performance (Section 4.1; Tables 3–6).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is an **empirical systems + algorithmic study**: it builds a family of autoregressive video token models (`Toto`) and evaluates how design decisions affect representation quality and scaling, with the core idea being “train a causal transformer to predict the next visual token” (Sections 3–4).

#### 3.4.1 System/data pipeline diagram in words (explicit step-by-step flow)

1. **Collect training data** from a mixture of image and video datasets (Section 3.3, Table 2):
   - `ImageNet`: 13.9M instances, 3.6B tokens.
   - `Kinetics-600`: 0.53M instances, 41.3B tokens, 1,496 hours.
   - `Ego4D`: 52.1K instances, 103B tokens, 3,750 hours.
   - `HowTo100m`: 1.172M instances, 2,560B tokens, 92,627 hours.
   - Combined pool: **~100,000 hours** and **~2.5T tokens**, while the reported full training uses **~1T tokens** (Section 3.3).

2. **Preprocess each video** by resizing and cropping:
   - The video is resized so its shortest side is `R` pixels, then a random crop of size `R × R × T` is taken (Section 3.4).
   - Frames are sampled every 4 frames (stride 4), and `T` is the number of frames per training sample (Section 3.4).

3. **Tokenize each frame independently** into a grid of discrete tokens:
   - Default tokenizer: `dVAE` (from DALL·E) with vocabulary size **8k** (Section 3.4).
   - With `R = 128`, each frame becomes a `16 × 16` token grid, i.e., **256 tokens per frame** (Section 3.4).
   - With `T = 16` frames, each training sequence is `T × 256 = 4096` tokens (Section 3.4), matching the stated **context length of 4k tokens** (Figure 1; Section 3.4).

4. **Convert the 2D token grids into a 1D sequence** using **raster scan ordering**:
   - Raster scan means reading tokens row-by-row (top-left to bottom-right) so spatial data becomes a single sequence (Section 3.1; Appendix A.1).

5. **Unify images and videos into the same training format**:
   - For videos: 16 frames are tokenized and concatenated to form a 4k-token sequence (Section 3.4).
   - For images: 16 images are sampled and concatenated as if they were “frames” to form a 4k-token sequence (Section 3.4).
   - Special tokens: the sequence includes start and end markers, with different start tokens for video vs image:
     - Video start token: `[1]`
     - Image start token: `[3]`
     - End token: `[2]` (Section 3.4)
   - **Ambiguity to note:** the paper states a 4096-token context length (Section 3.4; Figure 1) and also adds start/end tokens; it is not fully specified whether these special tokens are included within the 4096 count or appended beyond it.

6. **Train a causal transformer to predict the next token**:
   - The model defines the probability of a token sequence `x^j = (x^j_1, …, x^j_n)` as a product of conditional next-token probabilities (Section 3.1, Eq. (1)):
     - In plain language: the model predicts each token given all previous tokens in the sequence.
   - Training minimizes negative log-likelihood (Section 3.1, Eq. (2)):
     - In plain language: penalize the model when it assigns low probability to the true next token.

7. **Extract intermediate representations for downstream tasks**:
   - Let `H^l` be the hidden states after layer `l` (Section 3.2).
   - For downstream use, the paper probes intermediate layers rather than only the final layer, because performance often peaks around the model’s middle depth (Section 4.1 “Probing Layer”; Figure 4; Figure 8).

#### 3.4.2 Model architecture (what is built)

- `Toto` uses a **decoder-only transformer with causal attention**, aligned with `LLaMA`-style design (Section 3.2):
  - `RMSNorm` (pre-norm),
  - `SwiGLU` activation in the MLP,
  - `RoPE` positional embeddings.

- The layer update equations define a residual attention block then a residual MLP block (Section 3.2, Eq. (3)–(4)):
  - In plain language:
    - Normalize the hidden states, apply multi-head self-attention, and add it back (residual).
    - Normalize again, apply an MLP, and add it back.

- Model sizes and core architectural hyperparameters are given in Table 1:
  - `Toto-base`: **120M params**, hidden dim **768**, **12 heads**, **12 layers**.
  - `Toto-large`: **280M params**, hidden dim **1024**, **16 heads**, **16 layers**.
  - `Toto-1b`: **1.1B params**, hidden dim **2048**, **16 heads**, **22 layers**.  
  (Table 1)

#### 3.4.3 Training configuration and hyperparameters (what is explicitly specified)

- **Batch size:** `1M tokens` per batch (Section 3.2).
- **Optimizer:** `AdamW` (Section 3.2).
  - Max learning rate: `3e-4` (Section 3.2).
  - Betas: `β1 = 0.9`, `β2 = 0.95` (Section 3.2).
  - Warmup: `2000` steps (Section 3.2).
  - Learning rate schedule: `cosine decay` after warmup (Section 3.2).
  - **Not specified in provided text:** weight decay value, gradient clipping, EMA, dropout rates, precision (fp16/bf16), or exact hardware; the acknowledgments mention TPU setup help, but no hardware details are provided.

- **Training scale:** “over one visual trillion tokens” for pre-training (Section 3.1) and “full training utilized about 1 trillion tokens” (Section 3.3).

- **Context length:** `4096` tokens (Section 3.4; Figure 1).

- **Tokenizer setup (default):**
  - `dVAE`, vocab size `8k`, tokenize each frame independently (Section 3.4).
  - Training crop resolution: `R = 128` → `16×16` tokens per frame (Section 3.4).
  - Temporal length: `T = 16` frames, sampled every 4 frames (Section 3.4).

#### 3.4.4 Representation extraction and probing (how they measure “representation quality”)

- The paper uses **linear probing** and **attention probing/pooling** (Section 3.5):
  - **Average pooling probe:** global average pool token embeddings from a chosen layer, then train a linear classifier on top.
  - **Attention pooling probe:** a learned query token `q` cross-attends to intermediate tokens using learned projection matrices (`Wk`, `Wv`) to compute a weighted sum, producing a single representation vector (Section 3.5).
    - Motivation: in causal (decoder-only) models, later tokens “see” more previous context than earlier tokens, so uniform averaging can overweight tokens with smaller receptive fields (Section 3.5).

- **Layer choice matters:** best downstream performance often comes from **middle layers (~50% depth)** rather than the final layer (Section 4.1; Figure 4; Figure 8). The paper attributes worse performance in last layers to their role in reconstructing/predicting tokens (Section 4.1 “Probing Layer”).

#### 3.4.5 Design choices explored (what they vary and why)

1. **Tokenizer type** (Section 4.1; Table 3; Figure 3):
   - Discrete tokenizers: `dVAE`, `VQGAN` (multiple vocab sizes).
   - Continuous tokens: patch embeddings with normalized patch regression targets.
   - Key nuance: the paper argues `VQGAN` tokenizers may be indirectly contaminated with ImageNet label information due to perceptual loss using a VGG network (Section 3.4; Section 4.1).

2. **Token resolution strategy** (Section 4.1; Table 4):
   - Train cheaper at low token resolution (`16×16` tokens) then fine-tune at higher resolution (`32×32` tokens), leveraging `RoPE` to adapt positional embeddings.

3. **Architecture family** (Section 4.1; Table 6):
   - Compare `LLaMA`-style decoder-only transformer vs `GPT-2`-style vs `Mamba` (state-space model).

4. **Pooling/probing method** (Section 4.1; Table 5):
   - Average pooling vs attention pooling, showing large gains for attention pooling on ImageNet linear probing.

5. **Scaling behavior** (Section 4.9; Figure 9; Appendix A.5; Tables 15):
   - Use `µ-parameterization` to tune learning rates across widths and analyze compute-optimal scaling.

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

1. **Autoregressive pre-training from mixed image+video tokens yields broadly transferable representations**
   - The model is trained with a single objective (next-token prediction) and then evaluated across diverse tasks: ImageNet classification, Kinetics action recognition, Ego4D anticipation, DAVIS tracking, CATER object permanence, and robotics (Section 4.2–4.7).
   - Significance: it suggests that even without strong vision-specific inductive biases, decoder-only autoregressive modeling can be a viable representation learning strategy (Conclusion; also reflected in task results across Tables 7–12).

2. **Attention pooling is materially better than average pooling for decoder-only visual transformers**
   - Table 5 shows a large gap on ImageNet probing at the same layer and tokenization setup:
     - `Average pooling`: **53.2%** top-1
     - `Attention pooling`: **61.1%** top-1  
     (Table 5)
   - Why it matters: it addresses a decoder-only-specific issue—the receptive field is skewed because later tokens attend to more context (Section 3.5).

3. **Efficient resolution training strategy: low-res pre-train → high-res fine-tune works well, aided by RoPE**
   - Table 4 shows:
     - `dVAE/32` (full higher-res training) achieves **61.2%** top-1 at compute `5.68×10^17`.
     - `dVAE/16→32` achieves **63.2%** top-1 at compute `2.13×10^17`.
     - `dVAE/16→32†` (RoPE base `50,000`) achieves **64.4%** top-1 at the same compute.  
     (Table 4)
   - Significance: this is a practical recipe for reducing compute while improving downstream accuracy, and it ties directly to positional embedding adaptability (Section 4.1 “Resolution”).

4. **Intermediate layers are best for semantic tasks; last layers may specialize toward reconstruction**
   - Figure 4 shows ImageNet probing peaking around **~50% depth** across model sizes, and Figure 8 generalizes this to multiple tasks (ImageNet, Kinetics, DAVIS), with robotics showing a slightly different pattern where later layers can also be strong (Section 4.8; Figure 8).
   - This observation guides *how* to use decoder-only models as feature extractors (probe mid-layers, not the final layer).

5. **Compute-optimal scaling exhibits a power law but with a slower exponent than a referenced language-model scaling curve**
   - The paper fits a compute–loss power law for Toto (Section 4.9; Figure 9):
     - `L(C) = 7.32 · C^{-0.0378}`
   - It compares to a GPT-3 relation `L(C) = 2.57 · C^{-0.048}` and notes they are not directly comparable, but the smaller magnitude exponent suggests slower improvement per additional compute for visual next-token prediction (Section 4.9).

## 5. Experimental Analysis

### 5.1 Evaluation methodology (datasets, metrics, setup)

- **Pre-training data mixture** (Section 3.3; Table 2):
  - Mixed mini-batches are sampled approximately:
    - 20% ImageNet images,
    - 10% Ego4D videos,
    - 10% Kinetics videos,
    - 60% HowTo100m videos (Section 3.3).
  - Total pool ~2.5T tokens; training uses ~1T tokens (Section 3.3).

- **Core probing approach**:
  - For ImageNet and Kinetics: probe each layer using attention pooling and select the best-performing layer (“optimal layer”) (Section 4.2; Section 4.3).
  - For tracking (DAVIS): use features directly for nearest-neighbor label propagation without fine-tuning/probing (Section 4.5).

- **Metrics**:
  - ImageNet: Top-1 accuracy (Tables 3–7; Table 13–14).
  - Kinetics-400: Top-1 accuracy (Table 8; Appendix Table 16).
  - Ego4D anticipation: mean average precision for multiple targets (noun, noun+verb, noun+TTC, overall) (Table 9).
  - DAVIS tracking: `J`, `F`, and `J&F` scores (Table 10).
  - CATER object permanence localization: accuracy (%) at temporal resolutions 16 and 32 frames (Table 12).
  - Robotics: success rate and learning curves (Figure 6; Table 11).

### 5.2 Main quantitative results (with numbers and comparisons)

#### ImageNet-1k recognition
- Toto performance scales with model size (Table 7):
  - `Toto-base (120M)`: **64.7%** top-1
  - `Toto-large (280M)`: **71.1%** top-1
  - `Toto-1b (1.1B)`: **75.3%** top-1  
  (Table 7)

- Comparison context in Table 7:
  - Strong discriminative/self-supervised baselines are higher (e.g., `DINO` 80.1%, `DINOv2` 86.4%), while generative approaches vary (e.g., `MAE` 80.9%, `AIM` 80.6%).
  - Within autoregressive generative baselines, Table 7 includes iGPT numbers (65.2% for iGPT-L, 72.0% for iGPT-XL) but notes iGPT entries are evaluated with linear probing (Table 7 footnote †).

- Fair linear-probe comparison to iGPT (Appendix A.4; Table 14):
  - `Toto-1b`: **66.2%**
  - `iGPT-L (1.386B)`: **65.2%**  
  (Table 14)

- Full fine-tuning (Appendix A.3; Table 13):
  - Toto achieves **82.6%** on ImageNet-1K under the paper’s full fine-tuning setting, compared against several methods listed there (Table 13).
  - **Caveat:** the appendix states fine-tuning uses **full attention** (Appendix A.3), whereas pre-training uses causal attention (Section 3.2).

#### Kinetics-400 action recognition
- Scaling with model size is strong (Table 8):
  - `Toto-base`: **59.3%**
  - `Toto-large`: **65.3%**
  - `Toto-1b`: **74.4%**  
  (Table 8)

- With a higher-capacity attention classifier head variant (Appendix A.7; Table 16):
  - `Toto-1b`: **74.8%**
  - `Toto-large`: **65.8%**
  - `Toto-base`: **61.2%**  
  (Table 16)

#### Ego4D short-term action anticipation
- `Toto-large` achieves an **overall** score of **2.70** (Table 9), with sub-metrics:
  - Noun: 15.20
  - N+V: 6.75
  - N+TTC: 5.41
  - Overall: 2.70  
  (Table 9)

#### DAVIS semi-supervised tracking (label propagation)
- Table 10 reports `J&F` improvements with scale and (especially) resolution:
  - `Toto-base (256/8)`: **42.0** J&F
  - `Toto-large (256/8)`: **44.8**
  - `Toto-1b (256/8)`: **46.1**
  - `Toto-large (512/8)`: **62.4**  
  (Table 10)
- The paper notes that at large resolution (512), Toto-large outperforms listed baselines in that table (Table 10).

#### Object permanence (CATER localization)
- Table 12 reports Toto-large outperforming two baselines:
  - `Toto-large`: **62.8** (16 frames), **72.9** (32 frames) (Table 12).
- **Internal inconsistency to note:** the paragraph in Section 4.7 states Toto-large achieves **62.8% and 70.9%** for 16 and 32 frames, but Table 12 shows **72.9** for 32 frames. Based on the provided content, the table value (72.9) is the only explicit tabulated number.

#### Robotics
- Simulation: Figure 6 shows Toto-base learning faster than MAE-base across multiple tasks (Franka/Kuka pick & cabinet), but exact scalar values are not provided in the visible figure text; only qualitative curve comparisons are described (Section 4.6; Figure 6).
- Real-world: Table 11 reports success rates with the same number of demonstrations (`# Traj = 240`):
  - `MVP`: **75%**
  - `Toto-base`: **63%**  
  (Table 11)
  - The text says success is reported over **16 trials** with object variations (Section 4.6).

### 5.3 Design-choice experiments (what supports which claims)

- **Tokenizer choice has limited effect on ImageNet linear probing in their setup** (Section 4.1; Table 3):
  - Examples from Table 3 (all Toto-large trained 400 epochs on ImageNet-1k):
    - `VQGAN-VQGAN 16×16 (16k vocab)`: 61.3
    - `dVAE-dVAE 32×32 (8k vocab)`: 61.2
    - `patch-patch 16×16`: 60.6  
  - But `dVAE-dVAE 16×16` drops to **53.2**, indicating resolution/token count matters a lot (Table 3; also discussed in Section 4.1 “Resolution”).

- **Attention pooling is critical for decoder-only probing** (Table 5; Section 3.5 rationale).

- **Architecture matters: LLaMA-style > GPT2-style > Mamba (in this ImageNet linear probing study)** (Table 6):
  - `LLaMA (280M)`: 53.2
  - `GPT2 (280M)`: 48.5
  - `Mamba (~290M)`: 40.7  
  (Table 6)

- **Resolution training strategy with RoPE** improves accuracy-per-compute (Table 4; Section 4.1).

### 5.4 Do experiments convincingly support the paper’s claims?

- **Claim: “competitive performance across all benchmarks” with minimal inductive bias** (Abstract/Conclusion).
  - Supported in the sense that Toto is evaluated across many tasks (Sections 4.2–4.7) and achieves:
    - strong scaling trends (Tables 7–8),
    - competitive anticipation results (Table 9),
    - strong tracking at higher resolution (Table 10),
    - strong CATER localization (Table 12),
    - usable robotics performance (Table 11; Figure 6).
  - However, for recognition tasks the paper itself acknowledges discriminative methods often perform better (Sections 4.2–4.3; Tables 7–8).

- **Claim: “scaling curves similar to language models, albeit with a different rate”** (Abstract; Section 4.9).
  - Directly supported by the fitted power law in Section 4.9 (Figure 9), with an explicit exponent comparison to a GPT-3 scaling relation (Section 4.9).
  - The paper explicitly cautions they are “not comparable directly” (Section 4.9), which appropriately limits overclaiming.

- **Ablations / robustness**
  - The paper includes multiple ablations (tokenizer, resolution, pooling, architecture, probing layer; Section 4.1) and cross-task layer behavior (Figure 8).
  - Some potentially important controls are not fully specified in the provided text (e.g., exact pre-training compute budget in PF-days, hardware, data filtering/deduplication, contamination checks beyond the tokenizer note about VQGAN perceptual loss).

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

Based on the paper’s own limitations section plus implications of the methodology:

- **Internet video quality variance** can reduce performance compared to curated data, and introduces diversity/quality challenges (Section 5).
- **Tokenizer dependency (non end-to-end learning)**:
  - The model’s learning and generation quality are bounded by tokenizer quality; quantization limits fidelity, and the paper calls for a “universal visual tokenizer” (Section 5).
  - The paper also flags that some tokenizers (e.g., VQGAN trained with perceptual loss) may indirectly ingest label information (Section 3.4; Section 4.1), complicating “pure self-supervised” claims if such tokenizers are used.

- **Video redundancy may make next-token prediction “too easy” temporally**
  - Appendix A.1 and Figure 10 show the first frame has higher loss while later frames have lower average loss, interpreted as redundancy that can hinder learning efficient representations.

- **Design choices optimized on ImageNet may not be optimal elsewhere**
  - The paper’s design-choice conclusions are largely drawn from ImageNet classification experiments (Section 5), and transfer is not guaranteed for dense prediction, fine-grained recognition, or long-horizon temporal reasoning (Section 5).

- **Long-range temporal dynamics are not fully assessed**
  - Training uses `T = 16` frames with stride 4 (Section 3.4), which constrains temporal coverage per example; the paper notes extended temporal dynamics remain open (Section 5).

- **Missing methodological details (in provided content)**
  - The paper provides many key training hyperparameters (Section 3.2) but not others (weight decay value, dropout, augmentation specifics, dedup/contamination checks for the full video mixture, or hardware), limiting strict reproducibility from the excerpt alone.

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **Field-level implication: decoder-only autoregressive modeling is a viable vision/video pre-training paradigm**
  - Toto demonstrates that a causal transformer trained purely on next-token prediction can yield representations that work across semantics (ImageNet/Kinetics), temporal reasoning (Ego4D anticipation), correspondence (DAVIS tracking), object permanence (CATER), and embodied control contexts (robotics) (Sections 4.2–4.7).
  - This broad evaluation supports the idea that “language-model-style” training objectives can generalize beyond text, though recognition still trails top discriminative approaches in many settings (Tables 7–8).

- **Scaling implication: compute helps, but gains per compute may be smaller than text**
  - The compute-optimal scaling exponent `-0.0378` (Section 4.9) suggests progress with scale but slower loss improvement than the referenced GPT-3 curve exponent `-0.048` (Section 4.9). This motivates research into objectives or tokenizations that reduce redundancy and increase predictive difficulty (Appendix A.1).

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases suggested by the evaluations**
  - **Feature backbone for diverse tasks**: The probing and fine-tuning protocols show Toto can serve as a general representation provider (Section 3.5; Sections 4.2–4.8).
  - **Tracking via correspondence**: The direct use of intermediate features for nearest-neighbor label propagation (Section 4.5) indicates usefulness without task training.
  - **Robotics perception**: Even `Toto-base` runs in real time per the narrative and achieves 63% success in the reported cube-picking setup (Section 4.6; Table 11), suggesting applicability when compute is constrained.

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (when to prefer this method)**
  - Prefer Toto-style autoregressive pre-training when:
    - You want a **single pre-training objective** for both images and videos (Section 3.4).
    - You plan to use a **decoder-only transformer** and can exploit its generative nature (e.g., robotics tasks where later layers can remain useful; Figure 8).
  - Key integration choices supported by the paper:
    - Use **attention pooling**, not average pooling, when probing decoder-only representations (Table 5; Section 3.5).
    - Probe **middle layers** (~half depth) for semantic tasks (Figure 4; Figure 8).
    - Consider **low-res pre-train → high-res fine-tune** with `RoPE` adaptation for better accuracy-per-compute (Table 4; Section 4.1).
  - If the goal is peak recognition accuracy alone, the paper’s own comparisons show discriminative approaches can outperform generative autoregressive ones (Tables 7–8), so Toto may be more attractive when multi-task transfer and generative/sequence modeling benefits matter.
