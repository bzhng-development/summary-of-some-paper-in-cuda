# DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning

**ArXiv:** [2501.12948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948)

## 🎯 Pitch

This paper introduces DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrating that large-scale reinforcement learning (including a “pure RL” setup without supervised fine-tuning) can elicit long, self-verifying chain-of-thought reasoning and dramatically boost performance on hard reasoning benchmarks. By combining RL-driven discovery of reasoning behaviors with a cold-start/SFT refinement and distillation into smaller models, the approach offers a practical, lower-cost pathway to substantially stronger reasoning capabilities across math, coding, and STEM tasks.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

This paper develops `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` and `DeepSeek-R1`, reasoning-focused large language models whose reasoning ability is primarily improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), including a “pure RL” setting without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` (§1, §2.2). It shows that rule-based rewards plus an RL algorithm (`GRPO`) can substantially increase performance on hard reasoning benchmarks (e.g., AIME 2024 pass@1 from 15.6%→71.0% for `DeepSeek-R1-Zero`) while also revealing practical issues like poor readability and language mixing that motivate a multi-stage pipeline for `DeepSeek-R1` (§2.2.4, §2.3). The work further demonstrates that reasoning behaviors can be distilled into smaller dense models via SFT on a curated 800k-sample dataset, often outperforming applying RL directly to smaller base models (Table 5, Table 6, §4.1).

## 2. Context and Motivation

- **Problem / gap addressed.**
  - The paper targets the open problem of **effective test-time scaling for reasoning**: getting models to improve on math, code, science, and logic by generating longer, more structured reasoning (Chain-of-Thought, `CoT`) at inference time (§1).
  - It also targets a training pipeline gap: many prior approaches rely heavily on **large supervised datasets** (SFT) to obtain reasoning behavior, which is expensive to collect (§2.1, §2.2).

- **Why it matters.**
  - Reasoning improvements translate to better performance on high-stakes, well-defined tasks (math correctness, code correctness, STEM QA), and the paper frames post-training (RL/SFT after pretraining) as computationally cheaper than pretraining while still impactful (§1).
  - The paper also positions this as a step toward more general intelligent behavior, emphasizing autonomous “self-evolution” of reasoning through incentives (§1, §2.2.4).

- **Prior approaches and shortcomings (as characterized in the paper).**
  - Approaches explored in the community include **process-based reward models** (step-level supervision), RL, and search methods like **Monte Carlo Tree Search** and beam search (§1; §4.2).
  - The paper asserts that, prior to this work, none of these methods yields general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI’s `o1` series (§1). (The paper does not provide a complete historical survey; it provides selected citations and later compares against `o1` models in Tables 2 and 4.)

- **How this paper positions itself.**
  - It explicitly tests whether **reasoning can be incentivized through RL alone**, without an SFT “cold start,” by training `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` from `DeepSeek-V3-Base` using `GRPO` and rule-based rewards (§1, §2.2).
  - It then builds a practical model, `DeepSeek-R1`, by adding a small amount of cold-start CoT SFT and a multi-stage RL/SFT pipeline to improve readability, reduce language mixing, and broaden general capabilities (§2.3).
  - Finally, it argues that **distillation from a strong reasoning teacher** is a particularly effective way to endow smaller models with reasoning, often beating RL-on-small-models for a given compute budget (§2.4, §4.1; Table 6).

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Reader orientation (approachable technical breakdown)

- The system is a **post-training pipeline** that takes a pretrained base language model and makes it better at **solving verifiable reasoning problems** by optimizing it with reinforcement learning and carefully designed rewards.
- It solves the problem of **getting stronger reasoning and test-time scaling** (longer, more deliberate CoT) via `GRPO` RL plus rule-based verification, and then improves usability via cold-start SFT, additional SFT data generation, and a second RL stage for broader alignment (§2.2–§2.3).

### 3.2 Big-picture architecture (diagram in words)

- **Base model** (`DeepSeek-V3-Base`) → **RL stage (reasoning)** with `GRPO` + rule-based rewards → produces `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` (pure RL path) (§2.2).
- For `DeepSeek-R1`: **Cold-start SFT** (thousands of readable long-CoT examples) → **RL stage (reasoning)** (rule-based accuracy + language consistency reward) → **Rejection sampling** to generate a large SFT dataset (reasoning + non-reasoning) → **SFT retraining** → **RL stage (all scenarios)** using mixed reward signals (rule-based for reasoning; preference reward models for general prompts) (§2.3.1–§2.3.4).
- **Distillation path**: Use `DeepSeek-R1`-generated/curated 800k samples to SFT smaller base models (Qwen2.5 and Llama families) to produce `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-*` models (§2.4).

### 3.3 Roadmap for the deep dive

- I first explain the RL algorithm (`GRPO`) because it is the optimization core (§2.2.1, Eq. (1)–(3)).
- I then explain the reward signals and the training template, because rewards define what behavior is learned (§2.2.2–§2.2.3).
- Next I walk through the `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` training outcome and emergent behaviors to ground what RL changes in practice (§2.2.4; Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 3).
- Then I detail the four-stage `DeepSeek-R1` pipeline that addresses usability and generality issues (§2.3.1–§2.3.4).
- Finally, I cover distillation and the comparison between “RL on small models” vs “distill from a strong model” (§2.4, §4.1; Table 5, Table 6).

### 3.4 Detailed, sentence-based technical breakdown

This is an **empirical post-training algorithm/system paper** whose core idea is: **optimize a base LLM with large-scale RL using verifiable, mostly rule-based rewards to induce strong reasoning behaviors, then refine with staged SFT and RL for readability and general utility** (§2.2–§2.3).

#### System/data pipeline diagram in words (what happens first, second, third…)

1. **Start from a pretrained base model**:
   - The paper uses `DeepSeek-V3-Base` as the starting policy model for both `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` and `DeepSeek-R1` (§1, §2.2).
   - In the evaluation table, `DeepSeek-V3` and `DeepSeek-R1` are described as `MoE` models with `671B` total parameters and `37B` activated parameters (Table 4). The paper excerpt does not describe the internal MoE architecture beyond these counts.

2. **For `DeepSeek-R1-Zero`, apply RL directly (no SFT cold start)**:
   - The training uses `GRPO` (Group Relative Policy Optimization) to update the model using sampled outputs and their rewards (§2.2.1).
   - A fixed **output template** forces the model to emit a reasoning block and then an answer, with reasoning enclosed in `<think>...</think>` and the final answer in `<answer>...</answer>` (Table 1, §2.2.3).
   - Rewards are computed by a **rule-based reward system** with two components (§2.2.2):
     - **Accuracy reward**: checks correctness using deterministic verification when possible (e.g., “final answer in a specified format (within a box)” for math; compiler + test cases for LeetCode-style coding).
     - **Format reward**: checks whether the output follows the required tag structure (`<think>` / `</think>`).
   - The paper explicitly avoids neural reward models (outcome or process reward models) for `DeepSeek-R1-Zero`, citing risk of reward hacking and extra complexity/resources (§2.2.2).

3. **Understand `GRPO` precisely (the RL update rule)**:
   - Plain-language paraphrase before notation: for each question, the algorithm samples multiple candidate answers, scores them, and then updates the model to **increase the probability of better-than-average samples** while keeping the model close to a reference distribution using a KL penalty (§2.2.1).
   - The objective (Eq. (1)) is a PPO-like clipped policy gradient objective, but with a key twist: instead of learning a separate value-function “critic,” it uses the **group’s reward statistics** as a baseline, which saves compute (§2.2.1).
   - Definitions grounded in Eq. (1)–(3) (§2.2.1):
     - Let `q` be a question sampled from `P(Q)`.
     - Sample a group of `G` outputs `{o_1, …, o_G}` from the **old** policy `π_{θ_old}(O|q)`.
     - For each output `o_i`, compute a reward `r_i`.
     - Compute an **advantage** `A_i` using group normalization (Eq. (3)):
       - `A_i = (r_i - mean(r_1..r_G)) / std(r_1..r_G)`.
       - Intuition: an answer gets positive advantage if it scores above the group average, negative if below, with scaling by variability.
     - Update the policy `π_θ` by maximizing a clipped importance-weighted term (Eq. (1)) plus a KL penalty term:
       - `ε` is the clipping hyperparameter and `β` scales the KL penalty in Eq. (1).
       - The KL term is written in Eq. (2) as `D_KL(π_θ || π_ref)` with a specific estimator form.
   - **Micro-example (illustrating Eq. (3) without adding paper-unstated numbers):**
     - Suppose for a given question you sample `G` candidate solutions, and two are correct (high reward) while the rest are incorrect (low reward).
     - The correct solutions’ rewards exceed the group mean, so their `A_i` are positive, and the update increases their probability.
     - Incorrect ones fall below the mean, giving negative `A_i`, decreasing their probability.
     - This implements “learn from comparisons within the sampled group” without a learned critic.

4. **Observe emergent behavior and performance for `DeepSeek-R1-Zero`**:
   - Performance improves steadily during RL on AIME 2024 (Figure 2, §2.2.4):
     - The paper reports pass@1 increasing from `15.6%` to `71.0%` after “thousands of RL steps” (§1, §2.2.4).
     - It also reports a majority-vote (self-consistency) score of `86.7%` on AIME 2024 (Table 2, §2.2.4).
   - The model’s **average response length increases** over training (Figure 3, §2.2.4), which the paper interprets as the model learning to spend more “thinking time” (more reasoning tokens) to solve harder problems.
   - The paper highlights emergent behaviors such as **reflection** and exploring alternative solution paths, as well as an “aha moment” example where the model explicitly pauses and re-evaluates an earlier step (Table 3, §2.2.4).
   - Practical issues remain: **poor readability** and **language mixing** are documented drawbacks of `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` (§2.2.4), motivating a more engineered pipeline.

5. **For `DeepSeek-R1`, add a four-stage pipeline to improve usability and breadth** (§2.3):
   - **Stage 1: Cold-start SFT (thousands of examples)** (§2.3.1).
     - The goal is to avoid the “early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model” and to seed more readable reasoning.
     - The paper describes multiple data-collection routes (few-shot prompting with long CoT, prompting for reflection/verification, reformatting `R1-Zero` outputs, and human post-processing), and states that it ultimately collects “thousands” of cold-start samples (§2.3.1).
     - It defines a more readable output pattern: `|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>` where the summary condenses the reasoning results (§2.3.1).
   - **Stage 2: Reasoning-oriented RL (like `R1-Zero`)** (§2.3.2).
     - It reuses the same large-scale RL process, focusing on reasoning-intensive tasks with clear solutions (coding, math, science, logic) (§2.3.2).
     - It adds a **language consistency reward** to reduce language mixing, computed as the proportion of target-language words in the CoT (§2.3.2).
     - The final reward is the **sum** of reasoning accuracy reward and language consistency reward (§2.3.2).
     - The paper notes an ablation finding qualitatively: alignment for language consistency slightly degrades performance but improves readability (§2.3.2). (The excerpt does not provide the ablation table/values.)
   - **Stage 3: Rejection sampling + SFT retraining** (§2.3.3).
     - `Rejection sampling` here means: sample multiple model outputs per prompt and keep only those meeting acceptance criteria (e.g., correct answers, readable format).
     - **Reasoning SFT data**:
       - Generated from the converged RL checkpoint by sampling multiple trajectories and retaining correct ones (§2.3.3).
       - Expanded beyond purely rule-verifiable tasks by including some data judged by a “generative reward model” using `DeepSeek-V3` as judge given ground truth and prediction (§2.3.3).
       - Filtering removes mixed-language CoT, long paragraphs, and code blocks because outputs can be chaotic (§2.3.3).
       - Total reasoning samples: ~`600k` (§2.3.3).
     - **Non-reasoning SFT data**:
       - Reuses parts of `DeepSeek-V3` SFT dataset for writing, factual QA, self-cognition, translation, etc. (§2.3.3).
       - Sometimes uses `DeepSeek-V3` to generate a potential CoT before answering; for trivial queries (e.g., “hello”) no CoT is provided (§2.3.3).
       - Total non-reasoning samples: ~`200k` (§2.3.3).
     - The paper then fine-tunes `DeepSeek-V3-Base` for `2 epochs` on the combined ~`800k` dataset (§2.3.3).
   - **Stage 4: RL for all scenarios (helpfulness + harmlessness + reasoning)** (§2.3.4).
     - For reasoning prompts, it continues using rule-based rewards as in `R1-Zero` (§2.3.4).
     - For general prompts, it uses reward models capturing human preferences, building on the `DeepSeek-V3` pipeline with similar preference-pair distributions (§2.3.4).
     - A notable design choice is evaluation scope:
       - Helpfulness reward focuses exclusively on the **final summary** to avoid interfering with the underlying reasoning process (§2.3.4).
       - Harmlessness reward evaluates the **entire response** (reasoning + summary) to detect risky or harmful content (§2.3.4).

6. **Distillation into smaller models (SFT-only in this work)** (§2.4):
   - The paper directly fine-tunes several open-source base models on the same `800k` samples curated with `DeepSeek-R1` (§2.4).
   - Listed base models include:
     - `Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B`, `Qwen2.5-Math-7B`, `Qwen2.5-14B`, `Qwen2.5-32B`, `Llama-3.1-8B`, and `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` (§2.4).
   - For distilled models, it applies **only SFT** (no RL stage) to isolate the effect of distillation; it notes RL could further improve them but is left for the community (§2.4).

#### Core configurations and hyperparameters (only what is explicitly provided)

- **GRPO hyperparameters**: the objective includes `ε` (clipping) and `β` (KL coefficient) (Eq. (1)), but the excerpt does **not** provide their numeric values, nor `G` (group size) (§2.2.1).
- **Generation/evaluation settings** (§3, “Evaluation Setup”):
  - Maximum output length: `32,768` tokens per benchmark evaluation (§3).
  - Sampling-based evaluation:
    - Temperature: `0.6`.
    - `top-p`: `0.95`.
    - For each question, generate `k` responses, “typically between `4` and `64`,” then compute pass@1 as the average correctness across samples (§3).
  - AIME 2024 also reports `cons@64` (majority vote with 64 samples) (§3; Table 2, Table 5, Table 6).
- **Model size disclosure**:
  - `DeepSeek-R1` and `DeepSeek-V3` are MoE with `671B` total params and `37B` activated params (Table 4).
- **Training compute / optimizer / batch size / LR schedule / context window / tokenizer / layer counts**:
  - The provided excerpt does **not** include optimizer type/settings, learning rate schedule, batch size, number of layers, hidden size, attention heads, training tokens, hardware, or total RL steps for `DeepSeek-R1` (it does mention “over 10K steps” for one RL-on-Qwen experiment in §4.1).
  - Because the instruction requires these when available, the absence should be treated as “not specified in the provided paper content.”

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations

- **(1) Pure RL can induce strong reasoning without SFT cold start (validated at scale).**
  - What’s new: `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` applies RL directly on a base model without any supervised reasoning data (§1, §2.2).
  - Why it matters: It demonstrates large gains on reasoning benchmarks using only rule-based reward signals and a structured output format, e.g., AIME 2024 pass@1 `15.6%→71.0%` (§1; Figure 2).

- **(2) Group-based RL optimization (`GRPO`) as a practical alternative to critic-based RL.**
  - What’s new: `GRPO` removes the need for a critic model by using within-group reward statistics as a baseline (§2.2.1, Eq. (3)).
  - Why it matters: The paper motivates this as saving RL training cost while still enabling steady performance improvements (Figure 2).

- **(3) Multi-stage “cold start → RL → data generation → SFT → RL” pipeline for usable reasoning models.**
  - What’s new relative to `R1-Zero`: The four-stage pipeline targets readability, language consistency, and general capabilities while retaining reasoning strength (§2.3).
  - Why it matters: It directly addresses observed deployment-facing issues of pure RL (poor readability and language mixing) (§2.2.4, §2.3.1–§2.3.2).

- **(4) Distillation transfers reasoning patterns more effectively than RL on smaller models (in the paper’s comparisons).**
  - What’s new: The paper shows SFT distillation from `DeepSeek-R1` into smaller dense models yields large improvements and can outperform RL trained directly on a smaller base model (§2.4, §4.1).
  - Evidence of significance: Table 6 shows `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B` strongly outperforming `DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B` trained with >10k RL steps on multiple benchmarks.

- **Evaluation decoding** (§3):
  - Maximum generation length: 32,768 tokens.
  - To reduce variability and repetition under greedy decoding, the paper uses sampling with temperature 0.6 and top-p 0.95, generating `k` samples and computing pass@1 as the average correctness across samples (§3).
  - For AIME, it additionally computes `cons@64` via majority vote (§3).

  - Comparisons shown include `QwQ-32B-Preview` and `OpenAI-o1-mini` (Table 5).

    - GPQA Diamond pass@1: `55.0` vs `62.1`.
    - LiveCodeBench pass@1: `40.2` vs `57.2`.

### Do experiments support the claims?

- **Claim: Pure RL can strongly improve reasoning.**
  - Supported by the reported AIME improvement trajectory and the large jump from 15.6% to 71.0% pass@1 for `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` (Figure 2, §2.2.4, §1), plus cross-benchmark comparisons in Table 2.
  - The evidence is strongest on tasks with verifiable correctness and rule-based rewards (math/code), matching the training reward design (§2.2.2).

- **Claim: `DeepSeek-R1` reaches parity with `OpenAI-o1-1217` on reasoning tasks.**
  - Table 4 shows close performance on AIME 2024 (79.8 vs 79.2) and MATH-500 (97.3 vs 96.4), and near parity on Codeforces (2029 vs 2061 rating).
  - However, the paper also shows gaps on some benchmarks (e.g., GPQA 71.5 vs 75.7; SimpleQA 30.1 vs 47.0; Aider-Polyglot 53.3 vs 61.7) (Table 4).

- **Claim: Distillation is more effective than RL for small models (as tested here).**
  - Table 6 directly supports this for Qwen-32B: RL-trained `DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B` underperforms the distilled `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B` on all listed benchmarks (§4.1).

### Ablations, failure cases, robustness checks

- **Language consistency reward ablation**:
  - The paper mentions that adding language consistency reward slightly degrades performance but improves readability (§2.3.2). The excerpt does not include numeric ablation results.

- **Failure modes / unsuccessful approaches** (§4.2):
  - The paper reports unsuccessful attempts using a `PRM` (Process Reward Model) at scale due to step definition difficulty, intermediate correctness labeling difficulty, and reward hacking/complexity.
  - It also reports difficulties scaling `MCTS` for token generation due to enormous search space and difficulty training a fine-grained value model.

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs

- **Readability and language mixing as core trade-offs of pure RL (`R1-Zero`).**
  - `DeepSeek-R1-Zero` exhibits poor readability and language mixing (§2.2.4).
  - Fixing language mixing via a language consistency reward can slightly reduce raw performance, indicating a usability–accuracy trade-off (§2.3.2).

- **Reliance on verifiable tasks for clean rule-based rewards.**
  - The strongest RL signal comes from tasks where correctness can be checked reliably (math with deterministic answers; code with compilation/test cases) (§2.2.2, §2.3.2).
  - For broader “all scenarios” alignment, the pipeline must introduce preference reward models (§2.3.4), which reintroduces complexity the pure rule-based `R1-Zero` setting avoided (§2.2.2).

- **General capability gaps relative to the base model in some areas.**
  - The paper states `DeepSeek-R1` currently falls short of `DeepSeek-V3` on function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output (§5).

- **Prompt sensitivity.**
  - The paper observes that few-shot prompting degrades `DeepSeek-R1` performance and recommends zero-shot with explicit formatting instructions (§5).

- **Software engineering RL is limited by evaluation latency.**
  - The paper attributes modest improvements over `DeepSeek-V3` on some software engineering benchmarks to limited RL data and long evaluation times, which slow RL iteration (§3.1 discussion; §5).

- **Safety alignment can reduce answer rates / accuracy on some benchmarks.**
  - On Chinese SimpleQA, the paper attributes worse performance to refusals after safety RL and notes that without safety RL accuracy could exceed 70% (§3.1 discussion under Table 4). This is a clear alignment–coverage trade-off.

- **Missing reproducibility-critical training details in the provided excerpt.**
  - The excerpt does not specify optimizer, learning-rate schedule, batch size, training tokens, hardware, or the numeric values of key RL hyperparameters (`ε`, `β`, `G`) (Eq. (1)–(3)). This limits the ability to independently reproduce training exactly from the provided content.

## 7. Implications and Future Directions

- **How this changes the landscape (based on the paper’s evidence).**
  - The results suggest that **large-scale RL with carefully chosen, mostly rule-based incentives** can drive substantial improvements in reasoning behaviors (longer CoT, self-correction-like reflection) without supervised reasoning data in the initial stage (Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 3, Table 2).
  - The distillation results imply that once a strong reasoning model exists, **SFT distillation becomes a practical path** to distribute reasoning ability into smaller dense models (Table 5), and can outperform doing RL from scratch on those smaller models (Table 6, §4.1).

- **Follow-up research suggested by the paper’s findings.**
  - **Better multilingual consistency**: the paper explicitly flags language mixing outside Chinese/English and proposes future work to address it (§5).
  - **General capability integration**: improve function calling, multi-turn interaction, role-playing, and structured outputs while leveraging long CoT (§5).
  - **More efficient software-engineering RL**: use rejection sampling on software engineering data or asynchronous evaluation to reduce RL wall-clock time (§5).
  - **Community exploration of RL on distilled models**: the paper notes RL on distilled models can yield further gains but is not included in this work (§3.2 discussion; §2.4).

- **Practical applications / downstream use cases (grounded in evaluated tasks).**
  - Stronger performance on math (`AIME`, `MATH-500`) and competitive programming (`Codeforces`, `LiveCodeBench`) suggests use in **education/tutoring for problem solving**, **algorithmic coding assistance**, and **STEM QA** where correctness matters (Table 4).
  - Improved long-context QA on `FRAMES` suggests potential value in **document analysis** and “AI-driven search and data analysis tasks” as the paper notes (Table 4 discussion in §3.1).

- **Repro/Integration Guidance (from the paper’s explicit recommendations and setup).**
  - **Prompting**: Prefer **zero-shot** prompts that directly describe the task and specify output format; avoid few-shot prompting, which the paper reports as harmful for `DeepSeek-R1` (§5).
  - **Evaluation / deployment decoding**: The paper’s evaluation avoids greedy decoding for long-output reasoning due to repetition/variance and instead uses sampling (temperature `0.6`, top-p `0.95`) with multiple samples and optionally majority vote (§3). If you want stability for reasoning tasks, the paper’s own methodology suggests using multi-sample strategies rather than single greedy outputs.
  - **When to prefer distillation vs RL (as supported by Table 6)**:
    - If you have access to a strong reasoning teacher and want a smaller model, the paper’s evidence indicates **SFT distillation is more compute-efficient and yields better results** than large-scale RL on the smaller base model (Table 6, §4.1).
    - If your goal is to push beyond the teacher’s capabilities, the paper argues that this may still require **more powerful base models and larger-scale RL** (§4.1).
